Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to The Great Depression at JAMUN! This crisis committee promises to be a challenging experience as you navigate the deepest economic crisis of the 20th century.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,

Joshua Varon

Founder, JAMUN
