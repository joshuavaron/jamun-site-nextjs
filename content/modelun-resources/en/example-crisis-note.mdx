## Example Crisis Note - J. Robert Oppenheimer

*Committee:* Manhattan Project Crisis

### Note Text

**Dear Emily Roberts,**

My wonderful assistant! You have worked with me for over a decade, and I am still overjoyed every time I get the opportunity to send you a letter. Your service has been characterized by complete loyalty, discretion, and commitment; I appreciate everything that you have done for me very much.

As I'm sure you know, I can not disclose specific details of my recent work. That said, I have a task that I must ask you to do.

I can still remember the vacation my family and I took to Geneva, Switzerland. I yearn for the tranquil parks, lakes, and roads that popped up throughout the city. I would quite like to surprise my family with a vacation house there.

Over the next weeks, I will begin sending you money that I have earned in my recent work, as well as money that I have saved from my years spent in academia. Please begin collecting this money, as well as researching real estate in Geneva. If you find any promising properties please let me know, so I can consider whether it would be a wise investment.

**Yours very truly,**
**J. Robert Oppenheimer**

## Commentary

This crisis note demonstrates several effective techniques:

### 1. Establishing a Relationship

The letter opens by clearly establishing a long-term relationship with a loyal, fictional assistant. This gives the delegate a trusted contact who can carry out sensitive tasks.

> "You have worked with me for over a decade..."

### 2. Staying in Character

The note stays entirely in character as a personal letter. There are no out-of-character comments, parenthetical notes, or explanations to the crisis staff. The delegate writes as if actually sending this letter.

### 3. Giving Specific Instructions

The character (Oppenheimer) gives clear, actionable instructions:
- Collect money being sent
- Research real estate in Geneva
- Report back on promising properties

### 4. Hiding True Intentions

Though his true intention (to potentially flee the country) is hidden, his actions and requests align with that goal. The delegate doesn't explicitly state "I want to escape"—they let their actions speak.

### 5. Introducing Character Assets

The letter subtly introduces valuable character assets:
- A trusted assistant with a decade of loyalty
- Funds from government work and academia
- A family (potential motivation and vulnerability)

## Key Takeaways for Crisis Notes

1. **Create relationships** with fictional or real figures who can help you
2. **Stay in character** at all times—write as your character, not as a delegate
3. **Be specific** about what you want to accomplish
4. **Build gradually** toward larger goals
5. **Show, don't tell**—let your actions reveal your intentions
6. **Establish assets** that you can use later (money, allies, information, etc.)
