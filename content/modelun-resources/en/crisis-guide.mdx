Crisis committees offer a unique Model UN experience that differs dramatically from General Assembly simulations. Instead of representing countries, you play individual characters navigating evolving scenarios. Instead of writing lengthy resolutions, you draft quick directives and send private crisis notes. The pace is faster, the stakes feel higher, and creativity is rewarded.

This guide covers everything you need to succeed in crisis committees, from understanding the basic mechanics to developing sophisticated backroom strategies.

## What Makes Crisis Different

Crisis committees fundamentally differ from General Assembly committees in several key ways:

| Aspect | General Assembly | Crisis Committee |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Representation** | Countries | Individual characters |
| **Primary document** | Resolutions | Directives |
| **Scenario** | Static topic | Evolving crisis |
| **Committee size** | Large (50-150) | Small (15-30) |
| **Procedure** | Formal | Flexible and fast |
| **Private actions** | None | Crisis notes (backroom) |

### The Dual Nature of Crisis

Crisis committees operate on two parallel tracks that interact with each other:

**(a)** **The Frontroom** is the committee room where delegates debate, discuss, and pass directives together. This is the public face of the committee.

**(b)** **The Backroom** is an imaginary space where your character takes private actions through crisis notes. Only you and the crisis staff know what you're doing in the backroom—until your actions affect the frontroom.

Understanding how these two spaces interact is the key to mastering crisis committees.

## Understanding the Frontroom

The frontroom is where the committee meets together to respond to unfolding events. While it follows some of the same procedures as GA committees, everything moves faster.

### Crisis Breaks

Crisis breaks are short scenes—sometimes acted out live, sometimes announced through written updates—that introduce new developments into the committee's storyline. Crisis staff typically deliver these updates every 15-30 minutes.

**(a)** Crisis breaks might announce external events (a war has broken out, a natural disaster has struck, a political scandal has emerged).

**(b)** They might reveal the consequences of previous directives or backroom actions.

**(c)** They often require immediate responses from the committee.

**(d)** Some crisis breaks include "timed crises"—urgent situations that must be resolved within minutes or face consequences.

### The Frontroom Cycle

Unlike GA committees that move through distinct phases, crisis frontrooms operate in a repeating cycle:

**(1)** **Crisis Break**: Crisis staff delivers an update that changes the situation.

**(2)** **Questions**: Delegates clarify what happened and what resources are available.

**(3)** **Timed Crisis (Optional)**: If the situation is urgent, delegates must act quickly or face consequences.

**(4)** **Caucusing and Directive Writing**: Delegates debate in moderated and unmoderated caucuses while drafting directives.

**(5)** **Bloc Formation**: Delegates form coalitions around different approaches to the crisis.

**(6)** **Voting**: Directives are presented, debated, and voted on.

**(7)** **Repeat**: The cycle begins again with a new crisis break.

### Directives

Directives are the crisis equivalent of resolutions, but they're shorter, faster, and more action-oriented. While GA resolutions recommend actions, crisis directives actually make things happen in the simulation.

#### Directive Structure

**(a)** **Title**: A clear, often creative name for the directive (acronyms are popular).

**(b)** **Sponsors**: The main authors of the directive.

**(c)** **Signatories**: Delegates who want the directive brought to the floor.

**(d)** **Operative clauses**: Specific actions the committee is taking.

#### What Makes Good Directives

**(a)** **Be specific**: "Send troops to defend the northern border" is better than "improve national defense."

**(b)** **Be actionable**: Directives should do things, not just express opinions.

**(c)** **Be realistic**: Propose actions within the committee's actual power and resources.

**(d)** **Be timely**: Address the current crisis, not issues from three crisis breaks ago.

**(e)** **Consider consequences**: Think about how adversaries might respond to your directive.

### Frontroom Tips

**(a)** Write crisis notes during moderated caucuses. While others are speaking, you can be working on your backroom arc.

**(b)** The frontroom resembles GA procedure, just faster and more flexible. Chairs have more discretion to keep things moving.

**(c)** Collaboration makes big moves more likely to succeed. Coalition-backed directives carry more weight.

**(d)** Pay attention to every crisis break—they often contain clues about what's coming next or hints about other delegates' backroom actions.

## Understanding the Backroom

The backroom is where crisis committees really shine. Through crisis notes, you can take private actions that no one else in committee knows about—until those actions have consequences.

### What Are Crisis Notes?

Crisis notes are short letters your character writes to people outside the committee room. These might be real historical figures, fictional characters you create, organizations, or institutions your character has connections to.

**(a)** Crisis notes are written in character, as if actually sending a message to the recipient.

**(b)** Crisis staff read your notes and respond in character as whoever you're writing to.

**(c)** Your actions in crisis notes can succeed, fail, or have unexpected consequences depending on how realistic and well-planned they are.

**(d)** Successful backroom arcs can "break into the frontroom"—meaning your private actions become part of the committee's storyline.

### Who Can You Write To?

**(a)** **Historical figures**: If you're playing in a historical crisis, you can write to real people who existed at that time.

**(b)** **Fictional contacts**: You can create characters like advisors, family members, business partners, or old friends. Just establish the relationship clearly.

**(c)** **Organizations**: Military units, businesses, political parties, religious institutions—any organization your character might plausibly have contact with.

**(d)** **Other delegates' characters**: In some crises, you can communicate privately with other characters in the room.

### Writing Effective Crisis Notes

Strong crisis notes share several characteristics:

**(a)** **Be specific about what you want**: "I request that you send 500 soldiers to secure the eastern warehouse district" is better than "please send help."

**(b)** **Be realistic about your power**: Your actions should match what your character could actually accomplish. A low-ranking official can't command armies.

**(c)** **Be creative**: Think outside the box. The best crisis arcs often involve unexpected approaches.

**(d)** **Be strategic**: Consider how your actions fit into your larger goals. Don't just react—plan ahead.

**(e)** **Stay in character**: Write as your character would actually write. Use appropriate language, tone, and style for the period and your character's background.

**(f)** **Establish relationships**: Before asking for big favors, establish why this person would help you.

## Building a Backroom Arc

A backroom arc is your character's private storyline—the goals you're pursuing and the steps you're taking to achieve them. The best crisis delegates think strategically about building their arcs over the course of the committee.

### Phase 1: Establish Your Foundation

The beginning of committee is for establishing relationships and gathering resources.

#### Establish Relationships

**(a)** Decide who your character knows and why. Family members? Old friends? Professional contacts?

**(b)** Write early notes that establish these relationships. Reference shared history, inside jokes, or past favors.

**(c)** Fictional characters are allowed and often encouraged. Just make the relationship believable.

*Example opening:* "Dear Emily—It feels like just yesterday that we were creating ciphers together in Professor Varon's seminar. I find myself thinking of those simpler times as current events grow more complex..."

#### Build Up Resources

**(a)** Start collecting assets: money, information, allies, weapons, political support.

**(b)** These resources form the foundation for bigger moves later.

**(c)** Adapt your approach based on how the backroom responds. If one avenue closes, try another.

**(d)** Don't rush—building a solid foundation makes your later actions more likely to succeed.

### Phase 2: Test and Expand

Once you have a foundation, begin taking small actions to test your arc's strength.

#### Small Disruptions

**(a)** Take minor actions that advance your goals: leak information, make small investments, position your allies.

**(b)** These smaller moves help you gauge how the crisis staff will respond to your approach.

**(c)** They also build momentum toward larger actions.

#### A Note on Violence

Not every arc needs to be violent. Some of the most successful crisis delegates win through:

**(a)** Political maneuvering and alliance-building

**(b)** Economic power and business dealings

**(c)** Information gathering and strategic leaking

**(d)** Diplomacy and negotiation

**(e)** Cultural or religious influence

Violent arcs can be dramatic, but they also carry significant risks. Armies can lose battles, assassinations can fail, and aggressive actions often unite opponents against you.

### Phase 3: Execute Your Plan

The final phase of committee is when you use everything you've built to accomplish your main goal.

**(a)** This is when your accumulated resources and allies come into play.

**(b)** Keep your actions proportional to what you've built. Delegates who try to conquer nations with no preparation rarely succeed.

**(c)** Be prepared to adapt if things don't go as planned.

**(d)** Consider how your actions might affect the frontroom—a dramatic backroom success can shift the entire committee's direction.

## Crisis Committee Strategy

Beyond the mechanics, successful crisis delegates employ sophisticated strategies.

### Balance Frontroom and Backroom

**(a)** Don't neglect either space. Delegates who focus only on the backroom miss opportunities to shape committee direction. Delegates who ignore the backroom miss opportunities for individual achievement.

**(b)** Your backroom and frontroom actions should complement each other. Use frontroom directives to support your backroom goals, and use backroom actions to strengthen your frontroom position.

**(c)** Time management is crucial. You have limited attention—use it wisely.

### Read the Room

**(a)** Pay attention to other delegates' speeches and positions. They often hint at backroom arcs.

**(b)** Notice what's in the crisis breaks. Crisis staff often plant clues about what's coming.

**(c)** Track who's allied with whom and how those alliances shift.

### Build Alliances Strategically

**(a)** Identify delegates whose goals align with yours—they're natural allies.

**(b)** Consider surprising alliances. Your frontroom rival might be a useful backroom partner.

**(c)** Be careful who you trust. In crisis, betrayal is always possible.

### Respond Quickly

**(a)** Crisis rewards quick thinking. When a crisis break lands, start planning immediately.

**(b)** Have contingency plans ready. Think about what might go wrong and how you'd respond.

**(c)** Don't get paralyzed by analysis. In crisis, an imperfect action now often beats a perfect action later.

### Know Your Character

**(a)** Read your background guide thoroughly. Understand your character's powers, resources, motivations, and relationships.

**(b)** Stay in character consistently. Your character's personality should inform how you speak, write, and act.

**(c)** Think about what your character wants—not just what you want as a delegate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if my crisis note succeeded?

Crisis staff will respond to your notes, usually within one or two crisis cycles. Their response will indicate whether your action succeeded, failed, or had unexpected consequences. If you don't hear back, politely ask staff if they received your note.

### Can I work with other delegates in the backroom?

Sometimes. Some crises allow private communication between characters. Others require all communication to go through crisis staff. Ask your chairs about the specific rules for your committee.

### What if my backroom arc fails?

Adapt and rebuild. Failed arcs are opportunities to try new approaches. The best crisis delegates are resilient—they don't give up when things go wrong.

### How long should crisis notes be?

Quality matters more than quantity. A clear, specific note of a few sentences can be more effective than a rambling page. Include enough detail for staff to understand what you're doing and why.

### What should I do during my first crisis committee?

**(a)** Focus on understanding the mechanics before trying complex strategies.

**(b)** Write a few simple crisis notes to get comfortable with the format.

**(c)** Participate actively in frontroom debate.

**(d)** Don't be afraid to ask chairs or staff questions if you're confused.

**(e)** Most importantly, have fun—crisis committees are meant to be exciting and creative.

Crisis committees reward creativity, quick thinking, and strategic planning. The combination of public debate and private action creates opportunities for storytelling and gameplay that GA committees can't match. Embrace the chaos, stay in character, and don't be afraid to take risks. The best crisis experiences come when delegates fully commit to the simulation and see where the story takes them.
