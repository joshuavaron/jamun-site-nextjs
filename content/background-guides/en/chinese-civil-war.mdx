## Letter from the Chair

Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to SOCHUM at JAMUN! This committee promises to be an engaging and rewarding experience as we address the pressing humanitarian issues of homelessness and refugee displacement in Europe.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,

Joshua Varon

Founder, JAMUN

## Structure and Mechanics

The Chinese Civil War: The Republic at Bay, 1927 operates under a continuous crisis model. If this format is new to you, this section explains how the committee will function and progress.

A continuous crisis committee moves at a fast pace throughout every session. The experience splits into two main areas: the **front room** and the **backroom**. In the front room, you'll focus on collective action—drafting directives and reacting to periodic crisis breaks. The backroom is where individual strategy happens, as delegates communicate through private notes.

Think of the committee as a repeating cycle:

1. A crisis break occurs
2. Formal debate begins
3. Delegates draft directives
4. The committee votes on those actions
5. The Crisis Directors develop a new update based on your decisions
6. The cycle restarts

When the first session opens, you'll receive an initial crisis break establishing the primary obstacles facing the Nationalist High Command. Early updates will draw from the historical context in this guide. As time goes on, however, the narrative will shift to reflect the consequences of the private actions delegates take in the backroom. You'll manage these personal strategies by sending written notes to the staff.

Collective problem-solving happens through **directives**—specific plans designed to address the challenges presented in the front room. Passing these documents requires active participation: giving speeches, engaging in moderated debate, and forming coalitions during unmoderated caucuses. The backroom staff monitors these debates closely to ensure that future crisis breaks directly respond to your committee's choices.

### Personal Objectives

Every delegate should arrive with a clear personal objective for their character. These goals should be realistic enough to achieve within five sessions and don't necessarily have to align with the broader goals of the KMT government. You'll advance these personal agendas through your notes.

We strongly suggest using your very first note to define your character's intent. Notes should be written in character and addressed to a relevant individual, such as a trusted aide or a business associate. Providing clear instructions and a logical connection to your final goal will help the Assistant Chairs process your requests more effectively.

### Building Your Foundation

Your initial focus in the backroom should be gathering resources and building a strong foundation. Secure the necessary funding, logistics, and personnel for your operations before attempting major maneuvers.

**Important:** Requests for resources must remain grounded in the reality of 1927. Since this is nearly a century ago, the staff will not approve requests for modern computer technology or advanced rocketry.

Your personal notes should aim to be significant enough to impact the committee as a whole. Ideally, your individual actions will be so influential or disruptive that they eventually trigger a new crisis break for everyone to address.

We're eager to see the creative ways you use the tools available to you. We recommend reviewing the JAMUN website for standard crisis terminology and strategies before the conference. If you have any questions about these mechanics, feel free to ask the dais for clarification.

## History of the Problem

For over two millennia, China was defined by the Imperial system—a cycle of dynasties that rose and fell under the Mandate of Heaven. By the early 20th century, however, the Qing Dynasty was a shadow of its former self. Internal corruption, humiliating military defeats by foreign powers, and unequal treaties that surrendered Chinese land and law to Western and Japanese imperialists created a tinderbox of resentment.[^39]

### The Collapse of the Old Order

The Xinhai Revolution of 1911 was the spark that finally ended 2,000 years of monarchy. Led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and his Revolutionary Alliance, a wave of uprisings across southern China forced the young Emperor Puyi to abdicate.[^34]

In January 1912, the Republic of China was proclaimed in Nanjing, with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional president. But the new Republic was born fragile. To avoid a bloody civil war with the powerful northern military, Sun was forced to step down in favor of Yuan Shikai—a high-ranking Qing general who commanded the Beiyang Army, the most professional fighting force in the country.[^36] This compromise preserved peace but essentially handed the keys of the new democracy to a man with little interest in republican values.

### The Betrayal of the Republic

The dream of a stable, democratic China was short-lived. Yuan Shikai quickly moved to dismantle the power of Sun Yat-sen's party, now reorganized as the Kuomintang (KMT). He outlawed the party, dissolved the parliament, and in a shocking move in 1915, declared himself the new Emperor of China. This act of imperial restoration backfired spectacularly.[^38] It alienated his own generals, sparked revolts in the provinces, and caused the National Protection War.

When Yuan Shikai died of natural causes in 1916, he left behind a massive power vacuum. The central government in Beijing lost all authority over the provinces.[^34]

### The Warlord Era

The generals of the Beiyang Army, once loyal to Yuan, began competing for territory, tax revenue, and prestige. This marked the beginning of the **Warlord Era**—a decade of darkness where China was carved into personal fiefdoms.

Peasants were taxed years in advance by local strongmen who maintained private armies through forced cultivation of opium and brutal exploitation of the countryside. Infrastructure crumbled as railways were seized for troop movements and Yellow River dikes were neglected, leading to catastrophic flooding.[^30] The concept of China as a unified nation almost ceased to exist in practice; instead, it was a patchwork of warring states where survival depended on the whim of whichever general held the local garrison.

Through this era, the Nationalist government existed only in name. The reality on the ground was constant, grinding skirmishes between local strongmen who cared more for their personal wealth than the people they governed. The social fabric of the nation was torn as millions were displaced by fighting, and the lack of a central legal authority allowed foreign corporations and imperialist powers to further entrench their influence in treaty ports like Shanghai and Tianjin.[^22] This was a China defined by the gun, where the law ended at the gates of the local warlord's compound.

### The May Fourth Movement

While the warlords fought for territory, a cultural and intellectual revolution was brewing among the youth. In 1919, the Treaty of Versailles—which ended World War I—handed former German territories in China's Shandong province to Japan instead of returning them to China. This perceived betrayal by Western powers ignited the **May Fourth Movement**.[^21]

Thousands of students took to the streets of Beijing, sparking a nationwide strike that paralyzed the economy.

This movement was about more than just land—it was a rejection of "Old China." Intellectuals at Peking University, like Cai Yuanpei, argued that China needed to embrace science and democracy to survive. Two distinct paths emerged from this intellectual ferment: one was a revitalized Nationalism under a returned Sun Yat-sen, and the other was the birth of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1921.[^20] At first, these two groups were seen as siblings in the struggle against warlordism and foreign imperialism.

### The First United Front

By 1923, Sun Yat-sen realized that the KMT could never defeat the warlords through diplomacy or small-scale uprisings alone. He needed a modern army. Despite their growing ideological differences, the KMT and CCP entered into the **First United Front**. The goal was simple: unify China by force and end the Warlord Era.[^10] In 1924, the Whampoa Military Academy was established to train a new generation of officers loyal to the party rather than to a single general.

This era was defined by a strange, temporary alignment of goals. Nationalist officers and Communist organizers worked side-by-side to build a revolutionary machine. While the KMT provided the military framework and international legitimacy, the CCP focused on mass mobilization. They sent agitators into the countryside to promise land reform to peasants and into the cities to organize labor unions among factory workers.[^16] This dual approach meant that the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) didn't just capture cities—it arrived to find populations already primed for revolution.

This success, however, masked a growing dread among the KMT's business-aligned right wing. They watched with increasing alarm as CCP-led unions gained control over Shanghai's docks and Wuhan's steel mills. The alliance was a marriage of convenience that everyone knew was destined for a violent divorce.[^14] As long as the northern warlords remained a threat, the two parties maintained a facade of brotherhood—but the foundation was already beginning to crack.

### The Death of Sun Yat-sen

Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925 threw the KMT into another leadership crisis, but the momentum of the revolution continued. In 1926, the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) launched the **Northern Expedition**—a massive military campaign that swept northward from Guangzhou. To the surprise of international observers, the NRA was wildly successful.[^15]

Using a combination of military force and mass mobilization of peasants and workers, the KMT-CCP alliance crushed several major warlords and captured the key city of Wuhan. But the rapid expansion of territory meant that ideological cracks within the alliance were no longer easily hidden. The NRA was a patchwork of dedicated revolutionaries, opportunistic warlords who had switched sides, and radical communist agitators—all held together by the thin thread of a common enemy.[^10]

### The Shanghai Massacre (1927)

Success brought the underlying tensions of the United Front to a breaking point. As the NRA approached the industrial heart of Shanghai, the alliance fractured into two camps. The KMT Left-wing, based in Wuhan and led by Wang Jingwei, wanted to continue the social revolution and support worker uprisings. Meanwhile, the KMT Right-wing and military elite grew terrified of the rising power of labor unions and the radical land reforms the Communists were proposing.[^13]

On April 12, 1927, the fracture became a bloodbath.[^4]

In what is now known as the **Shanghai Massacre** or the **White Terror**, conservative forces within the KMT turned on their allies. Armed gangs and soldiers arrested and executed thousands of Communists, labor organizers, and suspected leftists in the streets of Shanghai. This was not a localized event—the purge spread to other cities under KMT control, forcing surviving Communists to flee to the countryside or go deep underground.[^9] The streets ran red with the blood of former allies, and the very foundation of the Republic was shaken by the realization that the revolution had turned inward.

### The Looming Threat of Uprising

The summer of 1927 has been a season of paranoia and preparation. While the Nationalist government attempts to consolidate its gains and establish a new capital in Nanjing, the remnants of the Communist Party have not been idle. Reports from intelligence officers suggest that the purge did not destroy the movement—it merely radicalized it.[^2]

Deep in the shadows of the central provinces, former members of the National Revolutionary Army who remained loyal to the CCP are beginning to move. Whispers of a massive mutiny in the city of Nanchang are growing louder. Intelligence suggests that high-ranking officers with communist sympathies are secretly stockpiling weapons and distributing pamphlets to rank-and-file soldiers. The tension is palpable.[^8]

The Communists, once junior partners in a grand alliance, are now an army in hiding, waiting for the perfect moment to strike back. As the Nationalist High Command gathers, the question is no longer *if* a rebellion will happen, but *when* the first shot will be fired. The Republic stands at bay, watching the horizon as the clouds of a total civil war gather over Nanchang.[^6]

## Statement of the Problem

The Republic of China stands at a crossroads where every path is littered with the debris of a broken revolution. While the History of the Problem outlines the tectonic shifts that brought us here, this section addresses the immediate crises the Nationalist High Command must solve to prevent a total collapse of the state.

We are not merely governing a nation; we are attempting to hold together a fragile coalition in the middle of a hurricane, where the winds of rebellion and the currents of economic ruin threaten to capsize the vessel of the Republic before it can even leave the harbor.[^5]

### The Shadow of Nanchang

As of August 1927, the most pressing threat to the Republic's survival is the disintegration of its own military units. The National Revolutionary Army (NRA), which so successfully marched north just a year ago, is now infested with dissent and ideological conflict that threatens to turn brother against brother. Intelligence reports from the central provinces indicate that the White Terror purges in Shanghai did not eliminate the Communist element—they simply drove it deeper into the ranks, where it now festers like a hidden wound.[^20]

In the city of Nanchang, the situation has reached a critical boiling point. Large portions of the 20th Army, under the command of He Long, and elements of the 11th and 4th Armies, have effectively ceased following orders from Nanjing.[^30] These soldiers are no longer just grumbling about rations or pay; they are distributing radical literature and holding secret meetings under cover of night. Our scouts report that ammunition stores in Nanchang are being raided by unidentified officers, and the local garrison is being purged of KMT loyalists.

If Nanchang falls to a mutiny, the KMT will lose more than just a city—it will lose its reputation as the legitimate military authority of China and the very mandate of heaven it seeks to protect. Furthermore, the threat is not localized to a single city or province.[^46] If a Red Army is allowed to form and escape into the rugged terrain of the Jinggang Mountains, they will be nearly impossible to root out, creating a permanent insurgency that will bleed the Republic dry for years to come.

The High Command faces a terrifying strategic reality: any attempt to crush the Nanchang mutiny requires moving troops from the northern front. This would leave us vulnerable to the surviving Beiyang warlords, currently licking their wounds and waiting for a moment of Nationalist weakness to reclaim their lost territories. We are essentially trapped in a strategic pincer movement where the threat from within is just as dangerous as the threat from without.[^43]

### The Economic Abyss

The Republic is functionally bankrupt, and the financial foundation of our government is as unstable as the front lines of the war. The Northern Expedition was astronomically expensive, and the cost of maintaining a standing army of hundreds of thousands of soldiers is draining the central treasury at a rate that is mathematically unsustainable. T.V. Soong and the Ministry of Finance are currently operating on emergency credit provided by the Shanghai banking cliques, but this support is conditional on restoring order and protecting private property from radical seizure.[^34]

The White Terror has had a devastating unintended consequence: the complete paralysis of urban industry across our most productive provinces. By purging labor unions and organizers, we have effectively shut down the docks and factories of Shanghai and Wuhan, as the workers who remain are either too terrified to work or are actively sabotaging production. Trade has slowed to a crawl, and the customs duties that usually fund our administration have evaporated.[^24]

In the countryside, the situation is even more dire. The dual taxation system of the warlord era has left the peasantry with nothing but bitterness and hunger. Without the social programs once promised by the United Front, the rural population is becoming increasingly susceptible to Communist promises of "land to the tiller."[^13] This creates a vicious cycle: the government cannot pay its soldiers, and an unpaid soldier is prone to desertion—or worse, joining the rebellion for the promise of a meal and a cause to believe in.

### The Problem of Political Legitimacy

Beyond the bullets and the bank accounts, there is a fundamental question of who truly speaks for the KMT and the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The **Wuhan-Nanjing Split** has left the party with two heads, each claiming to be the true successor of the revolution. Wang Jingwei's Left-KMT in Wuhan continues to harbor those who feel betrayed by the Shanghai Massacre, creating a government within a government that refuses to coordinate with the Nanjing administration. This internal civil war within the party itself makes it impossible to present a unified front to the people or the world.[^12]

Foreign powers are watching this internal strife with predatory interest, waiting for the moment the Republic fractures completely. The Western concessions in Shanghai and the Japanese presence in the north are currently maintaining a stance of armed neutrality, but this is a thin veil for their own imperialist ambitions. If the High Command cannot prove it has a firm grip on the country, these powers will likely intervene to "protect their own commercial interests"—or worse, begin funding whichever side promises them the most favorable treaties and concessions.[^15]

We are fighting a war on four fronts: against the Communist rebels in the shadows, against the warlords in the north, against the hunger of our own people, and against the ambitions of foreign empires.

### The Logistics of a Divided Nation

Communication and transport across the Republic are currently a nightmare of broken rails and cut telegraph lines. Much of the nation's rolling stock—locomotives and freight cars—is either destroyed or in the hands of regional commanders who refuse to release them for national use without significant bribes or political favors. This is not a minor inconvenience; it is a strategic catastrophe that prevents us from responding to crises in real-time.[^16]

Moving a single division from the southern coast to the central front currently takes weeks rather than days, as commanders must negotiate passage with local governors and navigate destroyed infrastructure. This delay gives the rebels in Nanchang and the warlords in the north the one thing the High Command cannot afford to give them: time.[^28]

Without centralized control over the nation's infrastructure, the High Command is essentially a group of leaders shouting into a void, hoping their orders are carried out by subordinates who are miles away and days behind. The Republic is a body where the nerves have been severed from the brain, and the limbs are moving without direction.[^39]

### The Immediate Mandate

Delegates, your task is not to debate the morality of the past, but to ensure the survival of the future. The problem is that the Republic is currently a house divided against itself, standing on a foundation of empty coffers and shifting loyalties. As you convene, the first reports of gunfire from the Nanchang garrison are already reaching the telegraph stations, signaling that the rebellion is no longer a potential threat. It is here, and it is hungry.

You must find a way to stabilize the economy, unify the military factions, and crush the brewing insurrection before it matures into a full-scale civil war that will consume China for decades. The mandate of heaven is slipping through our fingers; it is up to the High Command to seize it once more before the darkness of another era of chaos descends upon the Middle Kingdom.[^31]

## Portfolio Powers

Below are the detailed profiles for the members of the Nationalist High Command. Each delegate possesses unique Portfolio Powers that reflect their historical influence and specialized resources.

### General Bai Chongxi

Known as the "Little General," Bai Chongxi is a brilliant military strategist and a core leader of the New Guangxi Clique. Having played a pivotal role in the Northern Expedition, Bai is a master of mobile warfare and tactical positioning. In this committee, he represents the professional military elite who are often at odds with the central leadership in Nanjing. His primary goal is to maintain the autonomy of the Guangxi faction while effectively neutralizing the Communist threat through aggressive field maneuvers.[^45]

**Portfolio Powers:** Bai can command elite frontline divisions, providing the High Command with its most potent offensive tool. However, his actions often prioritize regional stability over the Generalissimo's centralizing ambitions.[^42]

**Delegate Focus:** Securing military dominance in the central provinces and ensuring the NRA remains a professional fighting force rather than a political tool.

### Admiral Chen Shaokuan

As commander of the Republic's fledgling Navy, Chen Shaokuan holds the keys to China's most vital artery: the Yangtze River. Educated in the United Kingdom and a veteran of the First World War, Chen is a modernizer who dreams of building a blue-water navy for China. In the current crisis, his role is defensive and logistical, tasked with preventing the "Red Infection" from crossing major waterways.[^1]

**Portfolio Powers:** Control over river gunboats and transport vessels, enabling him to blockade rebel-held ports and move supplies faster than any land-based unit.

**Delegate Focus:** Securing funding for naval expansion while ensuring that the Navy remains an impartial, professional branch of the service. He must navigate KMT politics to prove that the Navy is essential for national survival, especially in preventing Communist forces from regrouping across the river.[^7]

### Wang Jingwei

A protégé of Sun Yat-sen, Wang Jingwei is the charismatic face of the KMT's Left Wing. He views himself as the true heir to the revolution's social mission, emphasizing labor rights and peasant welfare over military authoritarianism. Following the Shanghai Massacre, Wang is in a precarious position, leading the Wuhan Government in opposition to Nanjing's right-leaning leadership.[^19]

**Portfolio Powers:** The ability to mobilize the masses—he can call for general strikes, influence student unions, and sway public opinion through populist rhetoric.

**Delegate Focus:** Steering the KMT back toward its revolutionary roots while preventing the party from fracturing entirely. He must decide whether to reconcile with the military elite or continue pushing for radical social reforms that might alienate the party's wealthy backers. For Wang, the struggle is for the soul of the Republic.[^12]

### Hu Hanmin

Hu Hanmin stands as the ideological gatekeeper of the Kuomintang. A close associate of Sun Yat-sen and a key drafter of the party's constitution, Hu represents the conservative, orthodox wing of the KMT. He believes in strict party discipline and is deeply suspicious of both Communist radicalism and warlord opportunism.

**Portfolio Powers:** Administrative and legalistic—he can launch internal investigations into party members, freeze the political assets of rivals, and issue binding ideological decrees.

**Delegate Focus:** Total purification of the party, ensuring that Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are interpreted correctly. He views the Communists not just as rebels, but as a cancer that must be excised from the body politic. Delegates in this role should focus on maintaining party purity and neutralizing the influence of the KMT Left.[^11]

### T.V. Soong

Tse-ven Soong is the Harvard-educated financial wizard of the Nationalist government. As Minister of Finance, he is responsible for the Herculean task of funding a revolutionary war while the national economy is in shambles. Soong acts as the bridge between the revolutionary government and the powerful financial interests of Shanghai and the West.

**Portfolio Powers:** Purely economic—he controls the central bank, manages customs revenue, and negotiates foreign loans.

**Delegate Focus:** Centralizing China's chaotic financial system and providing a steady stream of revenue to the military without causing hyperinflation. Soong must constantly balance the demands of the generals for more war funds with the need to maintain a stable currency. Without Soong's signature, no bullet can be bought and no soldier can be fed, making him perhaps the most influential civilian in the room.[^28]

### Soong Mei-ling (Madame Chiang)

The youngest of the famous Soong sisters, Mei-ling is a master of diplomacy and public relations. Educated at Wellesley College, she possesses a deep understanding of the Western psyche and uses this to advocate for the Republic on the world stage. While she lacks a formal government post in early 1927, her influence is felt through her family connections and her role as a high-level intermediary.

**Portfolio Powers:** International soft power—she can secure foreign medical aid, lobby Western journalists, and coordinate with international relief organizations.

**Delegate Focus:** Ensuring that the Nationalist cause is seen as a modern, Christian, and democratic movement by the United States and Europe. She must work to prevent foreign powers from viewing the KMT as just another group of warlords, ensuring that the Republic receives the diplomatic recognition and material support it needs.[^40]

### Du Yuesheng

Known as "Big-Eared Du," he is the undisputed leader of the Green Gang, the most powerful secret society in Shanghai. Du is not a politician or a soldier, but his influence over the city's underworld makes him an indispensable ally for the KMT. During the Shanghai Massacre, his laborers were the ones who carried out the purges on the ground.

**Portfolio Powers:** Clandestine influence—he can gather intelligence through his network of spies, perform extra-legal removals of targets, and control the flow of black-market goods.

**Delegate Focus:** Maintaining his criminal empire while gaining legitimate social standing within the new Republic. He wants to ensure that the KMT remains indebted to him, allowing his business interests to flourish without interference.[^30] He is the man you go to when the law is too slow or too public for the task at hand.

### Sheng Shicai

Sheng Shicai is the ambitious governor of Xinjiang, the vast frontier province in China's far west. Although nominally loyal to the KMT, Sheng operates as a virtual monarch in his own territory. Xinjiang is a land of massive mineral wealth and sits on strategic trade routes connecting China to the Soviet Union.

**Portfolio Powers:** Frontier resources—he can provide the High Command with rare minerals, horses for the cavalry, and safe passage for caravans.[^18]

**Delegate Focus:** Maintaining his autonomy and keeping his personal army well-equipped while the rest of China descends into civil war. He must navigate a delicate balance: appearing loyal enough to Nanjing to receive aid, but remaining independent enough to prevent the Central Government from actually taking control of his province.[^21] For Sheng, Xinjiang always comes first.

### Dr. Lin Qiaozhi

A graduate of the Peking Union Medical College, Dr. Lin Qiaozhi is a pioneer in maternal and public health. In a committee defined by soldiers and politicians, Dr. Lin represents the humanitarian conscience of the Republic.

**Portfolio Powers:** Social stability and public health—she can deploy medical units to disaster zones, manage refugee camps, and control the outbreaks of disease that often follow military campaigns.[^27]

**Delegate Focus:** Minimizing the human cost of the civil war and ensuring that the civilian population remains healthy and productive. She can use her medical neutrality to gain access to areas other delegates cannot, providing a unique form of soft intelligence. For Dr. Lin, the objective is to save the people that the generals are fighting over, ensuring that there is a nation left to govern once the smoke clears.[^14]

### Cai Yuanpei

Cai Yuanpei is the President of Peking University and the moral compass of the Chinese intelligentsia. A veteran of the 1911 Revolution and a scholar of European philosophy, he is revered by students and professors alike.

**Portfolio Powers:** Cultural and educational mobilization—he can spark student protests, influence the academic curriculum, and issue moral condemnations that carry immense weight in Chinese society.[^36]

**Delegate Focus:** Preserving academic freedom and fostering a New Culture that combines Western science with Chinese tradition. He is deeply wary of the KMT's turn toward authoritarianism and seeks to ensure that the Republic remains a pluralistic society. Delegates in this role must use their prestige to check the power of the military and advocate for the rights of the youth who will inherit the nation.[^6]

### Luo Longji

As a leading political scientist and influential journalist, Luo Longji is a tireless advocate for constitutional democracy and human rights. He represents the voice of the "Third Force"—those who reject both Communist radicalism and KMT military dictatorship.

**Portfolio Powers:** The printing press—he can publish exposés on corruption, write editorials that sway the urban middle class, and leak sensitive information to the public to force the government's hand.[^3]

**Delegate Focus:** Forcing the KMT to implement the constitutional stage of Sun Yat-sen's revolution, moving away from party tutelage and toward a multi-party democracy. He is a dangerous man for those with secrets, as his commitment to the truth often conflicts with the strategic needs of the High Command during wartime.[^11]

### K.P. Chen

Kuang-Fu Chen is the founder of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank and a titan of the private banking sector. Unlike T.V. Soong, who manages government money, K.P. Chen manages the wealth of the Chinese bourgeoisie.

**Portfolio Powers:** Private credit—he can issue loans to individual delegates, fund industrial projects, and move capital across international borders with ease.[^9]

**Delegate Focus:** Protecting the interests of the private sector and ensuring that the KMT provides a stable environment for investment. He wants to prevent the radical land and labor reforms of the left while also resisting the predatory taxation of the military. K.P. Chen's support is the barometer for the business community's faith in the Republic; if he pulls his credit, the economy collapses.[^27]

### Zhang Jian

Zhang Jian is an industrialist who built the city of Nantong into a model of modern textile manufacturing. He believes in national salvation through industry, arguing that China can only be strong if it produces its own goods.

**Portfolio Powers:** Industrial output—he can mass-produce uniforms, tents, and basic equipment for the NRA, as well as manage the logistics of wartime production.

**Delegate Focus:** Transforming China into an industrial power and ensuring that the KMT supports domestic manufacturing over foreign imports. Zhang is an elder statesman who views the chaotic politics of the era with disdain, preferring the tangible results of a well-run factory to the empty promises of politicians. His factories are essential for sustaining a long-term military effort against the rebels.[^31]

### Liu Hongsheng

Known as the "Match King," Liu Hongsheng is a diversified entrepreneur with interests in coal, cement, matches, and shipping. He represents the backbone of China's urban infrastructure.

**Portfolio Powers:** Control of essential commodities—he can ensure that cities have the fuel needed for heating and the cement needed for fortifications.[^29]

**Delegate Focus:** Expanding his industrial conglomerate while providing the logistical support necessary for the Republic's defense. Liu is a pragmatist who understands that wars are won in the coal mines as much as on the battlefields. He seeks to secure government contracts and infrastructure projects that will both aid the war effort and ensure his company's dominance in the post-war economy. To Liu, the Republic is a massive logistical puzzle that only he has the pieces to solve.[^24]

### Chen Lifu

A member of the powerful CC Clique and a close confidant of the Generalissimo, Chen Lifu is the head of the KMT's internal security and secret police. His role is to ensure that the party remains loyal and that Communist infiltrators are identified and dealt with.

**Portfolio Powers:** Surveillance—he can intercept mail, tap telegraph lines, and run a network of informants within the NRA and the civilian government.[^16]

**Delegate Focus:** The absolute security of the Nationalist regime, which he pursues with cold, administrative efficiency. Chen believes that in a time of civil war, civil liberties are a luxury the Republic cannot afford. He is the eyes and ears of the High Command, and his files contain the secrets of every other person at the table.[^12]

### Wellington Koo

Vi Kyuin Wellington Koo is China's most brilliant diplomat and a veteran of the Paris Peace Conference. He is a man of the world, equally at home in London, Washington, or Geneva.

**Portfolio Powers:** International law and arbitration—he can appeal to the League of Nations, negotiate the revision of the Unequal Treaties, and secure formal diplomatic recognition from foreign powers.

**Delegate Focus:** Restoring China's sovereignty and ending the era of foreign concessions through legal and diplomatic means. He wants to prove to the world that the Republic is a responsible member of the international community, deserving of equal treatment. Koo must use his immense prestige to prevent foreign intervention in the civil war while securing the international status the KMT craves.[^20]

### Li Shih-tseng

Li Shih-tseng is a unique figure—an anarchist-leaning intellectual who was also a founding father of the KMT. He is best known for the Work-Study program that sent thousands of Chinese students to France.

**Portfolio Powers:** The Chinese diaspora and intellectual networks—he can recruit overseas experts, secure funding from Chinese communities in Southeast Asia and Europe, and organize technical exchanges.[^30]

**Delegate Focus:** Modernizing China through education and mutual aid rather than through rigid central planning. He provides the High Command with a connection to the international scientific and anarchist movements, offering alternative solutions to the problems of rural poverty and industrialization. Li is a thinker who believes that the true revolution is won in the classroom and the laboratory.[^41]

### Butterfly Wu

The "Queen of Chinese Cinema," Butterfly Wu is a superstar whose face is known to millions across the Republic. In the 1920s, the film industry in Shanghai was a burgeoning power, and Wu was its brightest star.

**Portfolio Powers:** Mass media and soft power—she can star in propaganda films, host charity galas to raise war funds, and use her fame to boost the morale of the civilian population.

**Delegate Focus:** Elevating the status of the arts in China and ensuring that the KMT uses modern media to tell its story. She provides the High Command with a way to reach the illiterate masses, using the emotional power of the silver screen to forge a sense of national unity.[^10]

### Yan Xishan

The "Model Governor" of Shanxi, Yan Xishan has ruled his province with an iron fist and a meticulous eye for detail for over a decade. He is a warlord who joined the KMT because it was the most viable path to survival.

**Portfolio Powers:** Absolute control of a fortified province—he can provide a safe haven for KMT units, supply the army with locally produced weapons from his massive Taiyuan Arsenal, and manage the logistics of the northern front.

**Delegate Focus:** Keeping Shanxi independent and prosperous, regardless of who wins the civil war. He is a master of hedging his bets, often maintaining a private economy and an independent social system that blends Confucianism with modern socialism. To Yan, the Republic is a useful fiction, so long as it leaves Shanxi alone.[^19]

### Gu Weijun

A senior diplomat with deep ties to the foreign legations in Shanghai and Beijing. While similar to Wellington Koo, Gu focuses more on ground-level diplomacy in the treaty ports.

**Portfolio Powers:** Negotiation of sanctuary and extraterritorial access—he can negotiate with foreign consuls to protect KMT assets in the International Settlement or secure the release of prisoners held by foreign police.

**Delegate Focus:** Managing the friction between the Nationalist government and the foreign powers living within China's borders. He seeks to prevent a direct military conflict with the West or Japan while slowly chipping away at their privileges. Gu is the fixer who ensures that the KMT's domestic policies don't accidentally spark an international incident.[^37]
