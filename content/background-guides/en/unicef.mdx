## Letter from the Chair

Dear Delegates,

Welcome to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) at JAMUN. You're about to address one of the most consequential humanitarian failures of our era: the millions of children who have been denied their fundamental right to education because of war, displacement, and bureaucratic neglect.

The numbers are staggering. Nearly half of all school-aged refugee children globally remain out of school. In conflict zones, schools are being bombed, occupied by armed forces, or simply abandoned. And even when children escape to safety, they often face a second battle: navigating documentation requirements, language barriers, and housing instability that keep them locked out of classrooms.

This isn't just a humanitarian crisis. It's a security crisis. A generation of children without education becomes a generation without opportunity, vulnerable to radicalization, exploitation, and cycles of violence that perpetuate the conflicts they fled.

Your job is to find solutions that work in the messiest possible conditions: active war zones, overcrowded refugee camps, and underfunded reception centers. You'll need to think creatively about everything from mobile learning units to psychosocial support programs. We're looking forward to seeing what you come up with.

Best regards,

The UNICEF Dais

## History of the Committee

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is one of the oldest and most operationally distinct bodies within the United Nations system. The General Assembly established it in December 1946 through Resolution 57(I), initially naming it the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund.[^4] Its primary purpose? Providing immediate relief—food, clothing, and healthcare—to the millions of children and mothers left destitute after World War II. At first, UNICEF was meant to be temporary: a short-term extension of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) designed to bridge wartime chaos and peacetime reconstruction.[^9] But as the Cold War began and decolonization spread, the international community recognized that children's vulnerabilities weren't just symptoms of conflict—they were structural problems in global development. In 1953, the General Assembly voted to make the committee permanent, dropping "International" and "Emergency" from its name while keeping the familiar acronym.[^29]

UNICEF is governed by an Executive Board of 36 member states, elected by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) for three-year terms. These members are allocated based on geographic rotation across five regional groups, ensuring that the committee's policies reflect global consensus rather than any single region's agenda. Unlike DISEC or the Security Council, which focus on state-to-state security and disarmament, UNICEF's mandate is uniquely humanitarian and developmental. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989)—the most rapidly and widely ratified human rights treaty in history—serves as the legal framework guiding its operations.[^31] This mandate requires UNICEF to advocate for children's rights, help meet their basic needs, and expand their opportunities to reach their full potential. In conflict zones, this means taking a proactive role in safeguarding civilian infrastructure like schools and hospitals, which often become collateral damage—or deliberate targets—in modern asymmetric warfare.[^2]

A critical and often contentious feature of UNICEF is its financial structure. Unlike most UN agencies, UNICEF is funded entirely through voluntary contributions from governments, intergovernmental organizations, and the private sector. This reliance on non-assessed funding creates persistent tension between policy goals and fiscal reality.[^48] While the Executive Board approves high-level strategic plans and country program documents, actually implementing these policies depends on the shifting priorities of donor states. When major contributors reduce or eliminate their core funding—as recent legislative debates in major Western capitals have shown—UNICEF's ability to maintain long-term developmental projects like primary education systems becomes severely compromised.[^41] This dynamic forces the committee into a delicate balancing act: maintaining political neutrality while competing for limited resources, often prioritizing "earmarked" funds for high-profile emergencies at the expense of the "core" funding needed for systemic stability.[^37]

Today, UNICEF operates in over 190 countries and territories, maintaining a presence that often exceeds any other UN body. This vast field-based network allows it to act as a rapid-response mechanism during emergencies while simultaneously working toward multi-year development goals.[^19] But the committee's effectiveness is increasingly challenged by the changing nature of global conflict. As warfare moves from traditional battlefields into densely populated urban areas, protecting children has evolved from a straightforward humanitarian gesture into a complex legal and security challenge.[^16] UNICEF now finds itself at the intersection of international law and ground-level logistics, tasked with ensuring that children's rights—specifically the right to education—remain protected even when the state apparatus around them has collapsed. The history of UNICEF is thus a history of an ever-expanding mandate, struggling to reconcile its humanitarian origins with the harsh political and financial constraints of the 21st century.[^10]

## Statement of the Problem

The international community currently faces an unprecedented educational crisis. As of 2024, nearly half of all school-aged refugee children globally—approximately 7.2 million—remain out of school.[^6] While public attention often focuses on frontline battlefields in the Global South, a significant and growing "educational gray zone" has emerged within the European Union. Following protracted conflicts in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe, the European continent has become a primary destination for displaced families seeking the "right to education" enshrined in Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, for many of these children, crossing a national border doesn't signal the beginning of their education—it marks the start of a second, administrative battle.[^19]

The problem isn't simply a lack of physical classrooms—it's a structural failure of integration. Migrant and refugee children in Europe are nearly twice as likely as native-born children to leave school early, with only 3 in 5 students from migrant backgrounds achieving basic proficiency in science and mathematics.[^28] This gap stems from three systemic failures: the weaponization of bureaucracy through documentation requirements, the deterioration of physical infrastructure in reception centers, and the profound instability of child homelessness. Left unaddressed, this crisis threatens to create a "lost generation" of millions, undermining regional stability and violating the fundamental humanitarian principle that education is a life-saving intervention.[^45]

### Bureaucratic Barriers

In the modern state apparatus, a child without a birth certificate essentially doesn't exist. Just as the DISEC guide discusses "Digital Achilles Heels" in cybersecurity, the humanitarian sector has its own vulnerability: the lack of legal identity.[^31] Many refugee families fleeing active conflict zones arrive in Europe without the primary documents required for school enrollment—birth certificates, previous school transcripts, or national ID cards. In many European jurisdictions, school administrators effectively function as border guards, requiring "proof of residency" or "legalized translations" of documents that are impossible to obtain from a collapsed home government.[^25]

This "bureaucratic warfare" effectively freezes a child's development. In countries like Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania, national laws explicitly limit schooling rights for children in irregular situations. Even in states where education is theoretically universal, local municipalities often require a registered home address—a "Paperwork Fortress" that families living in emergency shelters or transit camps cannot scale.[^28] When a child is barred from school due to missing documentation, they don't just lose days of learning; they become vulnerable to the informal labor market, exploitation, trafficking, and recruitment by extremist groups.[^20]

### The Camp-to-Classroom Gap

The physical environment of European "Hotspots" and reception centers often resembles the very conflict zones families fled. In makeshift camps like the former "Jungle" in Calais or the overcrowded facilities on the Aegean islands, education is frequently treated as a secondary luxury rather than a primary right. Infrastructure in these areas is often deliberately uncomfortable—as some local officials have noted, designed to discourage further migration. This philosophy of deterrence has direct, devastating impacts on educational access.[^14]

Schools located within or near these camps are frequently underfunded, understaffed, and physically deteriorating. In Greece, reports indicate that at certain points, only 1 out of every 7 children in mainland camps could access formal education.[^12] The lack of transportation from remote facilities to local schools creates a physical barrier as effective as a locked door. And the "encampment" of refugees separates them from the host society's educational resources, creating segregated, low-quality "container schools" that provide only a fraction of the curriculum offered to native-born students. This infrastructure of containment ensures that even if a child is technically "enrolled," the quality of their education remains insufficient to bridge the gap created by displacement.[^19]

### The Invisible Crisis of Homelessness

A home serves as the "hidden curriculum" of education—it provides the stability, nutrition, and space necessary for cognitive development. For migrant families in Europe, however, homelessness is often a chronic condition characterized by constant mobility.[^17] Families are frequently moved between hotels, emergency shelters, and transit centers with little notice, shattering any attempt at educational continuity. This "educational churn" means a child might start a school year in Paris only to be relocated to a rural facility 300 kilometers away by mid-semester, losing their social connections and academic progress.

The daily reality of homelessness—waking up at 5:30 AM to travel across a city from a shelter to school, having no space to do homework, facing the social stigma of "dirty uniforms" due to lack of laundry facilities—leads to high rates of chronic absenteeism and dropout. These children suffer from "toxic stress," a physiological response to instability that inhibits the brain's ability to process new information. In this context, the classroom becomes a site of exhaustion rather than learning. Without a stable home base, the primary school system remains an inaccessible fortress for Europe's most vulnerable children.[^23]

## History of the Problem

The way we think about education in conflict zones has transformed radically over the last three decades. Throughout the mid-20th century, the international community viewed education as a "second-tier" humanitarian need—a developmental goal to address only after hostilities ended and "life-saving" needs like food, water, and shelter were met. This hierarchy meant that during the Cold War, millions of children in proxy-war zones remained out of school for years, as the UN lacked a professional framework for "Education in Emergencies" (EiE). The global perspective didn't shift until the 1990s. The 1990 World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien, Thailand, first articulated that education is a basic human right that must be respected even during disasters. But the subsequent decade of civil wars and ethnic cleansing exposed a terrifying reality: educational infrastructure was no longer just collateral damage—it had become a deliberate target.[^31]

### The Sarajevo Precedent

The 1990s provided a grim case study in how educational rights deteriorate during urban warfare. The Siege of Sarajevo (1992–1996) marked a turning point in UN monitoring of knowledge infrastructure destruction. The deliberate shelling of the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina in August 1992—which destroyed nearly two million books and manuscripts—signaled that schools and universities were being targeted to erase a population's cultural and intellectual identity.[^37] During this period, education in Sarajevo was forced into "basement schools," where teachers and students operated in constant fear of snipers. This era exposed a critical gap in international law: while the 1949 Geneva Conventions prohibited targeting civilian objects, no specific enforcement mechanisms existed to ensure that schools remained sanctuaries. This failure led to the landmark 1996 Machel Report, which provided the first comprehensive UN assessment of armed conflict's impact on children, officially classifying education as a primary humanitarian protection.[^42]

### The 2015 Migrant Crisis

While the 1990s focused on education inside conflict zones, the 21st century shifted attention to education after displacement. The 2015 European Migrant Crisis represented a systemic failure of the international refugee regime to manage the long-term educational needs of millions. As over one million refugees and migrants—primarily fleeing the Syrian Civil War—arrived on European shores, host nations' education systems proved fundamentally unprepared for the scale of the influx.[^39] Governments that had previously championed the 1951 Refugee Convention found themselves unable—or unwilling—to bypass national bureaucratic requirements for school enrollment.

This period saw the emergence of "administrative deterrence," where states used documentation requirements as legal weapons to keep refugee children out of national classrooms. In Greece and Italy, the rapid establishment of overcrowded reception centers led to "informal education centers" run by NGOs—well-intentioned, but often lacking recognized curricula or certification.[^24] The 2015 crisis proved that the "right to education" was fragile: a promise that couldn't hold under the pressure of mass displacement. The legacy is a patchwork of European policies prioritizing border security over integration, leaving millions of children in educational limbo that continues to define UNICEF's agenda today.[^33]

### Education as an Instrument of War

In the modern era, the problem has evolved from physical destruction to ideological weaponization. In conflict zones across the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, schools are increasingly used as military barracks or recruitment centers. Between 2020 and 2021 alone, there were over 5,000 reported attacks on education and military uses of schools globally.[^21] This tactical shift forces UNICEF to operate in "high-threat" environments where schools themselves become battlegrounds. Furthermore, the digitalization of education has introduced new vulnerabilities. Just as DISEC monitors "Digital Achilles Heels" in cyber-warfare, UNICEF must now contend with "Educational Achilles Heels"—situations where the lack of digital infrastructure and birth-registration databases prevents displaced children from accessing remote learning or proving their educational history.[^28] The problem is no longer just about building schools; it's about protecting the data and legal identity that allow a child to enter one.

## Past Actions

The international community's response to eroding educational rights has evolved from reactive, post-conflict reconstruction to a sophisticated, multi-layered "Education in Emergencies" (EiE) framework.[^26] Over the past three decades, UNICEF, alongside the General Assembly and regional partners, has developed legal, financial, and logistical tools designed to maintain educational continuity amid European migration and conflict. These efforts have successfully elevated education to a "life-saving" intervention in global discourse. Yet implementation in Europe has been plagued by a persistent gap between high-level diplomatic agreements and local municipal compliance.[^30]

### The Safe Schools Declaration

The most significant political achievement of the last decade is the Safe Schools Declaration (2015). Launched at the First International Conference on Safe Schools in Oslo, Norway, the Declaration is an inter-governmental political commitment giving states the opportunity to express support for protecting and continuing education during armed conflict.[^34] Central to the Declaration is the endorsement of the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict. These guidelines provide concrete steps for armed forces to avoid using educational facilities as barracks or munitions depots—practices that effectively turn schools into legitimate military targets.[^38]

By 2024, over 118 nations had endorsed the Declaration, including the vast majority of European states. Its success is visible in its normative impact: it has successfully "de-normalized" military occupation of schools in international law.[^36] But its effectiveness as a preventive tool remains uneven. While it has changed military doctrine in countries like Switzerland and Norway, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine demonstrates that without binding enforcement mechanisms, the Declaration remains a "soft law" instrument.[^37] Since 2022, thousands of educational facilities in Eastern Europe have been damaged or destroyed—highlighting that while the diplomatic shield is broad, it's often too thin to withstand high-intensity warfare.

### No Lost Generation

In response to the protracted nature of displacement, UNICEF and its partners pioneered the "No Lost Generation" (NLG) initiative. Originally launched in 2013 to address the Syrian crisis, NLG was specifically designed to move beyond short-term emergency aid toward sustainable integration. The initiative's primary success lies in its "holistic" approach, bundling formal schooling with mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS).[^21] This acknowledges that a child who has survived a Mediterranean crossing or urban bombardment cannot learn effectively without first addressing the trauma.

As NLG adapted for European host countries, it focused on expanding national capacity rather than building parallel NGO-led systems. In countries like Germany and Sweden, UNICEF worked with national ministries to integrate refugee children into "Willkommensklassen" (welcome classes). These initiatives were initially hailed as a logistical triumph—by 2017, Germany had successfully enrolled over 200,000 refugee children in its state system.[^29] Yet NLG's success has been uneven. In "frontline" states like Greece and Italy, the framework has struggled under the weight of the "Hotspot" system. The result? A two-tiered educational reality where "No Lost Generation" works effectively in wealthy destination states but fails to reach children in transit camps, who often wait years for their first day of formal schooling.[^38]

### Systemic Integration: All Children in Education

Recognizing that bureaucratic barriers are as effective as physical walls, UNICEF has recently shifted focus toward the "All Children in Education" (ACE) program and similar regional initiatives. These target the "Paperwork Fortress" described earlier.[^44] In 2021, UNICEF Greece, partnering with the European Commission, launched ACE to facilitate refugee children's transition from non-formal "learning centers" into the formal Greek public school system. The initiative includes deploying "Education Coordinators" who serve as liaisons between refugee families and local school boards, helping navigate the complex documentation requirements that typically block enrollment.[^11]

ACE represents a "success through persistence" model. By providing interpretation services and cultural mediation, the program has reached over 15,000 children previously excluded from the state system.[^1] Yet these programs' limited continental impact stems from their voluntary and temporary nature. Most are funded through the "Education Cannot Wait" (ECW) fund or the EU's humanitarian budget, meaning they're subject to three-year renewal cycles. When funding ends or political priorities shift toward border security, these "integration bridges" are often the first to be dismantled.[^8] The UN has proven it can create integration tools. What it has yet to secure is the long-term political and financial commitment from European member states needed to make them universal.

## Possible Solutions

### The Universal Enrollment Mandate

The primary barrier to education in Europe is the decentralized nature of school enrollment, which allows local municipalities to implement restrictive documentation policies. To counter this, UNICEF proposes an International Mandate for Universal Enrollment (IMUE). This framework would require signatory nations to adopt a "Presence-Based Enrollment" policy, where a child's physical presence in a territory is the sole legal requirement for school admission.[^3] Under IMUE, lacking a birth certificate or residency permit would no longer justify exclusion. Instead, states would be mandated to enroll children in formal schools within 30 days of arrival, providing temporary "educational status" while legal identity documents are processed.[^15]

To support this mandate, a UN-led "Education Passport" system should be implemented. Rather than relying on physical transcripts from collapsed home governments, UNICEF could host a secure, global database tracking a student's learning progress, grade level, and language proficiency.[^13] This system would use simplified "Digital Identity" protocols—essentially a digital locker for educational achievements—that travels with the child across borders. By creating a standardized, internationally recognized certificate of learning, the UN can ensure that a child who starts primary education in a Turkish transit camp can continue it in a German classroom without losing years of progress to "administrative re-evaluation."[^4]

### Integrated Housing-Education Hubs (IHEHs)

To address the profound instability of child homelessness and the "educational churn" caused by forced mobility, the committee must reconsider reception architecture. Current "hotspot" facilities are designed for temporary containment, not long-term development. UNICEF advocates transitioning toward Integrated Housing-Education Hubs (IHEHs).[^6] Unlike traditional camps, IHEHs are semi-permanent residential facilities designed as "community-in-a-box" ecosystems. These hubs would feature on-site accredited primary schools, primary healthcare clinics, and psychosocial support centers—all within a stable residential environment.[^16]

The IHEH model's goal is to separate education from a family's formal housing status. In many European cities, families move from shelter to shelter, forcing children to change schools multiple times yearly. An IHEH would provide a "guaranteed school seat" for the duration of a family's asylum process, regardless of their specific room assignment or hotel placement.[^22] By placing classrooms within residential hubs, transportation barriers are eliminated. These hubs would also serve as "integration bridges," where local language instructors and social workers work alongside refugee families to prepare them for eventual transition into the general public school system. This transforms the "infrastructure of containment" into an "infrastructure of opportunity."[^9]

### Global Digital Infrastructure

As recent conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have shown, physical schools are often the first targets of warfare. To ensure that the "right to education" isn't physically dependent on a single building, the UN must invest in a Global Digital Education Infrastructure (GDEI). This isn't simply a collection of online videos—it's a robust "hybrid learning backup" system that can be activated the moment a physical school becomes inaccessible. GDEI would provide standardized primary curricula in multiple languages (Arabic, Dari, Ukrainian, French, and more) that are accredited by major European education ministries.[^7]

This solution addresses "educational gaps" for children in transit or living in remote, under-resourced areas. By providing high-quality, offline-capable digital learning kits (similar to an expanded "School-in-a-Box" but with tablets and satellite connectivity), UNICEF can ensure that learning continues even when a child is "between homes."[^10] Crucially, this system must be paired with a "Digital Certification" mandate, ensuring that work completed through GDEI is legally recognized by European state schools. This prevents the "informal education" trap, where children spend years in NGO classes only to find their work uncredited by host governments.[^8] By modernizing educational delivery, the committee can make the school system as mobile as the children it serves.

## Potential Blocs

The geopolitics of education in conflict zones are shaped by a fundamental tension between humanitarian universalism and national sovereignty. While the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides shared legal language, member states are deeply divided on how much international bodies like UNICEF should be allowed to bypass national administrative protocols. The crisis of child homelessness and educational exclusion in Europe has split the committee into several distinct ideological and logistical blocs, each prioritizing a different balance between border security, fiscal responsibility, and human rights.

### The Sovereignty Bloc: National Prerogative Defenders

The Sovereignty Bloc consists of nations that view education primarily as a national service rather than a universal right superseding border controls. These states—often in Central and Eastern Europe—emphasize that integrating migrant children must be secondary to maintaining national security and the rule of law. For this group, "bureaucratic warfare" isn't a systemic failure but a necessary filter ensuring that only those with legal residency rights access taxpayer-funded services.[^13] These nations are likely to oppose any "Universal Enrollment Mandate" or "Digital Education Passport" that functions without state-led identity verification. They argue that supranational mandates infringe on their right to manage their own public school systems and that providing high-quality education to "irregular" migrants may create a "pull factor" encouraging more migration.[^36] For delegates in this bloc, the focus is on strengthening borders first, with education being a privilege granted only after a child's legal status is fully regularized.

### The Frontline Advocates: Infrastructure-Heavy Reformers

Located at primary entry points for refugees, the Frontline Advocates (largely Southern European and Mediterranean nations) face the most immediate pressure regarding physically housing arrivals. Because of the Dublin Regulation, these nations are often the legal "entry points" responsible for processing thousands of refugees arriving by sea. Their priority is mandatory burden-sharing and decentralizing reception centers. They advocate for expanded educational access but are deeply wary of any mandates without significant international funding. For this bloc, the "Statement of the Problem" is a matter of logistical overload. They support the "Integrated Housing-Education Hub" (IHEH) model, provided costs are shared globally through UNICEF's voluntary contribution pool.[^11] They often criticize current European funding cycles, arguing they're forced to manage a continental crisis with localized, temporary budgets. Their goal in any resolution is shifting responsibility for "holding" refugees toward a collective, infrastructure-heavy UN response that provides immediate relief to their domestic school systems.

### The Destination States: Integration-First Regulators

The Destination States (primarily Western and Northern European powers) host the largest raw numbers of refugees within their borders. These nations generally support human rights-based solutions like "Housing First," but they're also the most vocal about these programs' "economic sustainability." This bloc views the educational crisis as a threat to future social cohesion and regional stability. They generally support "Digital Identity" solutions and integration bridges like the "No Lost Generation" framework, as they see these tools as essential for transforming refugees into productive members of society.[^26] However, they are often "regulators" who demand high standards of data security and curriculum alignment. While they're often the largest financial contributors to UN funds, they face significant domestic pressure to restrict social welfare access to prevent "pull factors." They advocate for solutions including private sponsorship and community hosting to relieve the burden on the state.

### The Non-European Donor Group: "Stand-Back" Supporters

This bloc includes major international powers outside Europe who provide a significant portion of UNICEF's budget but aren't directly impacted by the localized migration crisis. These states often take a "stand-back" approach, advocating for high-level declarations and "Safe Schools" norms while remaining hesitant to interfere in European nations' internal administrative policies. They're most likely to support "Digital-First" solutions and the Global Digital Education Infrastructure (GDEI), as these are cost-effective and don't require the UN to manage physical real estate like IHEHs.[^40] For this group, the priority is maintaining the normative strength of the Convention on the Rights of the Child without getting embroiled in specific sovereign disputes between European states. They serve as "middle-power mediators," often pushing for compromises emphasizing technological innovation over controversial legal mandates.[^3]
