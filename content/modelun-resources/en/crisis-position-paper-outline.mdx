Crisis committee position papers differ significantly from General Assembly papers. Instead of representing a country's position on a topic, you're introducing a character, their goals, and their strategies. This outline will help you write an effective crisis position paper.

## Header

Include the following information at the top of your position paper:

**(a)** Your character name

**(b)** Committee name

**(c)** Your name and school (if required by the conference)

## Introduction: Who Are You?

Your introduction should establish your character and why they matter.

### Key Questions to Answer

**(1)** Who are you? (Name, title, occupation, role in the committee)

**(2)** What is the setting? (Time period, location, context)

**(3)** What makes you important? (Power, wealth, connections, expertise)

**(4)** What are your key relationships? (Family, allies, rivals)

### Elements to Include

**(a)** Your character's name, title, and position

**(b)** Your character's background and how they reached their current position

**(c)** Key relationships that might influence your actions

**(d)** Resources and assets at your disposal

### Example Introduction

> "Cardinal Thomas Wolsey serves as Lord Chancellor of England and Archbishop of York under King Henry VIII. Rising from humble origins through the Church, Wolsey has become one of the most powerful figures in England, controlling much of the kingdom's domestic and foreign policy. With vast wealth from his ecclesiastical positions, a network of loyal servants, and the ear of the King, Wolsey wields influence that rivals the nobility themselves."

## Paragraph 1: Frontroom Goals (Committee)

This paragraph describes what your character will do publicly—in the committee room, during debate, and through directives.

### Structure

**(a)** **Topic Sentence**: What are your character's public goals in committee? What do you want to achieve that others will see?

**(b)** **Portfolio Powers**: What can you do because of your position? What resources and authority does your role give you?

**(c)** **Evidence**: What specific details from your character's background support your ability to achieve these goals?

**(d)** **Analysis**: Why do you want to achieve these goals? How do they serve your character's interests?

**(e)** **Committee Impact**: How do your goals contribute to or affect the committee as a whole?

### Key Questions

**(1)** What will you advocate for during debate?

**(2)** What kind of directives will you support or propose?

**(3)** Who will you try to ally with publicly?

**(4)** What public image do you want to project?

### Example Paragraph

> "In committee, Cardinal Wolsey will work to maintain England's delicate balance of power with France and the Holy Roman Empire. Using his authority as Lord Chancellor, Wolsey will advocate for diplomatic solutions that preserve English interests while avoiding costly wars. He will seek alliances with moderate nobles who share his vision of a stable, prosperous England, and will propose directives that strengthen the Crown's authority while appearing to serve the common good."

## Paragraph 2: Backroom Goals (Personal)

This paragraph describes your private agenda—what you'll pursue through crisis notes and individual actions.

### Structure

**(a)** **Topic Sentence**: What are your character's private goals? What do you want to achieve that others may not know about?

**(b)** **Methods**: How will you use crisis notes to pursue these goals? Who will you contact? What resources will you deploy?

**(c)** **Evidence**: What specific details from your background enable these actions?

**(d)** **Analysis**: Why are these goals important to your character personally? What drives them?

**(e)** **Character Impact**: How will achieving these goals affect your character's position, power, or future?

### Key Questions

**(1)** What do you want to achieve privately?

**(2)** Who can help you achieve these goals?

**(3)** What resources will you use?

**(4)** What risks are you willing to take?

### Example Paragraph

> "Privately, Wolsey will work to secure his position against ambitious rivals at court. Through crisis notes, he will cultivate relationships with loyal agents who can gather information on potential threats. He will quietly accumulate wealth and properties that can serve as insurance against royal disfavor. Most importantly, Wolsey will seek to make himself indispensable to the King, ensuring that any attempt to remove him would be too costly to contemplate."

## Conclusion

Summarize your character's key goals and abilities.

### Elements to Include

**(a)** Your two or three most important goals (both public and private)

**(b)** The key skills, resources, or relationships that enable you to pursue these goals

**(c)** How you see your character's role in the committee's story

### Example Conclusion

> "Cardinal Wolsey enters this committee with clear objectives: publicly, to maintain England's position in European affairs and strengthen the Crown; privately, to secure his own power and protect against rivals. With vast wealth, extensive intelligence networks, and the trust of King Henry VIII, Wolsey possesses the tools to achieve these aims—if he can navigate the treacherous waters of Tudor politics."

## Tips for Strong Crisis Position Papers

**(a)** **Know your background guide**: Your character's powers and limitations come from the background guide—study it carefully.

**(b)** **Think strategically**: Consider how your frontroom and backroom goals might complement or conflict with each other.

**(c)** **Be creative but realistic**: Ambitious goals are good, but they should be achievable given your character's actual position.

**(d)** **Consider relationships**: Crisis committees are about interactions between characters—think about how you'll work with (or against) others.

**(e)** **Stay in character**: Write as your character would think and speak, not as yourself.
