## History of the Committee

The Assembly of the African Union (AU) is the supreme decision-making body of Africa's leading intergovernmental organization. Established in 2002, the Assembly represents decades of work toward Pan-African unity, succeeding the Organization of African Unity (OAU) founded in 1963. While the OAU focused primarily on liberating African states from colonial rule and dismantling apartheid, the African Union marked a significant shift toward a more integrated, proactive approach for the twenty-first century.[^10] The Assembly consists of the Heads of State and Government from all 55 member nations, meeting twice a year to set common policies and priorities. Unlike its predecessor, which strictly avoided interfering in members' internal affairs, the AU Assembly operates under a "non-indifference" mandate. This grants it authority to intervene in member states facing grave circumstances like war crimes or crimes against humanity.[^40]

As the highest decision-making body, the Assembly monitors policy implementation and ensures member states comply with Union objectives. These include promoting peace, security, and stability, as well as protecting human rights as outlined in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.[^36] The Assembly's powers are extensive: it adopts the annual budget, appoints judges to the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, and directs the Executive Council on emergency and conflict management. Decisions are reached primarily through consensus, or by a two-thirds majority when consensus cannot be achieved—ensuring that diverse perspectives from all African regions are represented.[^35]

When addressing transnational challenges like human trafficking, the Assembly provides the political will necessary to harmonize national laws and foster cooperation between Regional Economic Communities (RECs).[^4] Since adopting the Constitutive Act of the African Union, the committee has increasingly focused on social and economic integration as a path toward a prosperous Africa built on inclusive growth and sustainable development. The Assembly remains the only body capable of mobilizing the collective resources and legal authority required to combat threats that undermine the dignity and safety of African citizens.[^9]

## Statement of the Problem

Human trafficking in Africa has evolved into a sophisticated, multi-billion-dollar criminal industry that fundamentally undermines the sovereignty and security of the African Union's member states. Often called "modern slavery," this crime encompasses the recruitment, transportation, and harboring of individuals through force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of exploitation. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), approximately 7 million people in Africa are currently trapped in forms of modern slavery—a staggering rate of 5.2 people for every thousand inhabitants on the continent. This crisis isn't merely a humanitarian concern. It's a security threat that fuels organized crime, destabilizes regional economies, and thrives in the shadows of weak governmental transparency and systemic corruption.[^19]

### The Conflict-Trafficking Connection

In regions plagued by instability, such as the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, armed conflict serves as the primary catalyst for human trafficking. Armed groups and non-state actors frequently use trafficking as a weapon of war to sustain their operations and terrorize civilian populations. In countries like South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), children are abducted and forcibly recruited as child soldiers, while women and girls are subjected to sexual slavery in rebel encampments. When the rule of law collapses during conflict, traffickers operate with total impunity.[^12]

Conflict-driven displacement also leaves millions in Internal Displaced Persons (IDP) camps, where the lack of formal protection mechanisms makes refugees prime targets for predatory criminal networks using false promises of jobs or safety.[^27] In these environments, the basic need for survival often outweighs the ability to vet potential employers, leading to a cycle of re-victimization that humanitarian agencies struggle to break.

### Forced Migration and Deadly Routes

The desperation of individuals seeking to escape poverty or violence has created high-risk migration corridors, most notably the Eastern Route to the Arabian Peninsula and the Central Mediterranean Route to Europe. In 2024, the number of migrants crossing from the Horn of Africa to Yemen nearly tripled, reaching over 73,000 recorded individuals. Along these routes, migrant smuggling often transitions into human trafficking as travelers are kidnapped for ransom or forced into labor to pay off debts to smugglers.[^20]

The lack of coordinated border management among AU member states allows traffickers to move victims across multiple jurisdictions, making it nearly impossible for any single nation to intercept these transnational flows without deeper continental integration.

### Economic Exploitation and Supply Chain Slavery

A significant portion of trafficking in Africa is driven by global demand for cheap labor and raw materials. Over 3.8 million Africans are currently subjected to forced labor, particularly in high-risk sectors such as artisanal mining, commercial agriculture, and fishing.[^39] In the cocoa plantations of West Africa and the cobalt mines of Central Africa, systemic child labor persists, with an estimated 72 million children across the continent engaged in some form of labor—the highest proportion of any region in the world.

This exploitation is often hidden within the complex global supply chains of multinational corporations. When governments fail to regulate these industries or protect workers' rights, they inadvertently allow bonded labor systems to persist, where entire families are forced to work under the weight of inescapable debt.[^45]

### Domestic Servitude

Unlike high-profile transnational trafficking, domestic servitude occurs behind closed doors in urban centers across Africa. This form of trafficking often involves children, particularly girls, who are sent from rural villages to cities under the guise of receiving an education or working as helpers. Once in the household, these victims are frequently subjected to physical abuse, denied contact with their families, and forced to work grueling hours for little to no pay.[^43]

Because this occurs within the private sphere, it is one of the most difficult forms of trafficking to detect and prosecute. The social normalization of informal fostering systems in some cultures can blur the lines between traditional practices and criminal exploitation, complicating the AU's efforts to harmonize legal definitions.[^21]

### The Transparency Deficit

The most significant barrier to eradicating trafficking is the widespread lack of governmental transparency and the presence of official corruption. Trafficking networks simply cannot operate on a massive scale without the implicit or explicit cooperation of state actors. In several member states, reports have surfaced of law enforcement officers, border guards, and high-ranking officials accepting bribes to look the other way—or even participating in trafficking syndicates.[^18]

When government funds intended for border security or victim protection are embezzled, the state's ability to respond to the crisis is crippled. Without robust frameworks for accountability and whistleblower protection, anti-trafficking laws remain "paper tigers"—legal on record but ignored in practice by those in power.

This deficit of transparency creates a culture of impunity where the risks for traffickers are low and the rewards for corrupt officials are high, effectively making the state a silent partner in modern slavery.[^4]

### The Digital Frontier

The digital age has introduced a new and alarming dimension to trafficking: forced criminality and cyber-fraud. In recent years, trafficking networks have begun luring educated African youth with promises of tech-sector jobs—only to transport them to scam compounds where they're held captive and forced to conduct online fraud and cryptocurrency scams.[^34]

While this trend has been most visible in Southeast Asia, emerging hubs are being identified within Africa itself. This "digital slavery" is particularly dangerous because it uses the victim as a tool for further crime, often leading to the victim's arrest by authorities who fail to recognize their status as a trafficked individual.[^1]

### Gendered Trafficking

Trafficking in Africa is deeply gendered. Women and girls account for over 60% of detected victims. While men and boys are predominantly trafficked for forced labor in mining and construction, women are disproportionately targeted for sexual exploitation and forced marriage. In 2021, an estimated 3.1 million Africans were living in forced marriages, often as a result of negative coping mechanisms used by families in extreme poverty or conflict zones.[^6]

These victims face a double burden: the trauma of their exploitation and the social stigma that often follows their escape or rescue. The Assembly must address these gender-specific vulnerabilities to ensure that modern slavery does not continue to rob the continent's women of their agency and future.[^15]

### The Erosion of Sovereignty and Security

The persistence of human trafficking represents a profound erosion of the African state. Trafficking generates an estimated $13.1 billion in illegal profits annually in Africa alone—funds that are frequently used to finance insurgencies and undermine democratic institutions. When a government cannot protect its citizens from being bought and sold, its legitimacy is brought into question.

The transnational nature of the crime means that instability in one member state quickly spills over into its neighbors, creating a domino effect of insecurity. For the African Union Assembly, the challenge is not just to stop a crime, but to rebuild the integrity of national borders and the transparency of government institutions to protect the dignity of all Africans.[^16]

## History of the Problem

The history of human trafficking in Africa is inextricably linked to the legacy of historical exploitation and the subsequent challenges of post-colonial state-building. While the transatlantic and Indian Ocean slave trades were abolished in the 19th century, the structural vulnerabilities they created persisted into modern times: economic underdevelopment and the fragmentation of social protection systems. Following the independence movements of the 1950s and 60s, many newly sovereign African nations inherited borders that were porous and difficult to monitor—providing a geographical foundation for the illicit movement of people that would evolve into today's modern trafficking networks.[^31]

### Early Continental Responses

In the immediate post-independence period, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) focused primarily on eradicating colonialism and promoting political sovereignty. During this time, trafficking as a distinct legal concept was rarely addressed; instead, issues of forced labor were often viewed through the lens of traditional practices or colonial-era labor remnants.[^17] It was not until the late 20th century that the continent began to witness a shift from traditional forms of servitude to the highly organized, profit-driven criminal syndicates that characterize the current crisis.

The 1980s and 90s saw a surge in internal conflicts across the continent, which fundamentally altered the landscape of exploitation. As civil wars erupted in countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Rwanda, the mass displacement of civilians created a supply of vulnerable individuals, while the collapse of state institutions removed any barrier to their exploitation.[^24] This era marked the first significant rise in the forced recruitment of child soldiers on a continental scale—a practice that forced the OAU to begin reconsidering its strictly non-interventionist stance in favor of human rights protections.

### From Palermo to the AU

The year 2000 represented a watershed moment for the global and continental fight against trafficking with the adoption of the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children—commonly known as the Palermo Protocol. This international treaty provided the first globally accepted definition of human trafficking, distinguishing it from migrant smuggling and focusing on the triad of the act, the means, and the purpose.[^19] This legal clarity was essential for African states, as it allowed for the harmonization of national laws and the creation of specialized anti-trafficking units within police forces.

Following the Palermo Protocol, the transition from the OAU to the African Union in 2002 signaled a new level of commitment to human security. In 2006, the AU adopted the Ouagadougou Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and Children. This plan was the first comprehensive continental framework to address trafficking through the "Four Ps": Prevention, Protection, Prosecution, and Partnership. It urged member states to treat trafficking not merely as a domestic issue, but as a transnational security threat that required shared intelligence and joint border patrols.[^26]

### Post-Cold War Instability

The end of the 20th century brought a vacuum in regional security that international criminal organizations were quick to exploit. With the decline of superpower patronage after the Cold War, many insurgent groups turned to illicit trades—including human trafficking—to fund their operations. In West Africa, the blood diamond trade of the 1990s was heavily reliant on forced labor, demonstrating a clear link between resource exploitation and the trafficking of persons.[^23]

This period also saw the professionalization of trafficking routes. Traffickers began utilizing the same paths used for centuries by salt and gold traders in the Sahara, but adapted them for the modern transport of human cargo.[^11] The lack of transparency in emerging African markets and the absence of robust financial regulations allowed these groups to launder their profits with ease, further embedding trafficking into local and regional economies.

### The 2010s Migration Crisis

The most dramatic escalation in African trafficking occurred following the 2011 Arab Spring and the subsequent collapse of the Libyan state. For decades, Libya had served as both a destination for African labor and a buffer between Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. After the fall of the Gaddafi regime, Libya descended into lawlessness—becoming a massive hub for human trafficking. Global headlines in 2017 shocked the world with footage of actual slave auctions in Libya, where migrants from West and East Africa were being sold into forced labor for as little as $400.[^29]

This crisis exposed the catastrophic consequences of regional instability. The "Libya Vacuum" demonstrated that when a central authority collapses, trafficking networks can effectively take over entire cities, operating detention centers where thousands of victims are subjected to systematic torture and extortion.[^8]

This event forced the AU Assembly to prioritize the migration-trafficking nexus and led to the creation of the AU-UN-EU Tripartite Taskforce to evacuate and protect stranded migrants.[^38]

### Attempts at Legal Harmonization

Despite progress made in the early 2000s, anti-trafficking efforts in Africa have been characterized by repeated stalemates regarding implementation of continental protocols. While nearly all AU member states have ratified the Palermo Protocol, the domestication of these laws—meaning their integration into local legal systems—has been uneven. Disagreements over the definition of exploitation in traditional contexts and the lack of resources to fund victim protection programs have frequently stalled progress.[^35]

Many member states have also prioritized border securitization to stop illegal migration rather than focusing on protecting trafficked individuals within those flows. This has often led to the criminalization of victims—a trend that the AU Assembly has struggled to reverse. The tension between national sovereignty and the need for a unified continental police force (AFRIPOL) remains a significant hurdle that continues to influence modern negotiations.[^32]

### Multi-Sectoral Exploitation

As we entered the 2020s, trafficking became increasingly diversified. While earlier history focused primarily on sexual exploitation and child soldiery, the last decade has seen a massive expansion into commercial sectors. The green energy boom has increased trafficking in the DRC's cobalt mines, as global demand for battery minerals outpaced the ability of the state to regulate labor. Similarly, the expansion of commercial agriculture in East Africa has seen a rise in seasonal trafficking, where laborers are moved across borders for harvest and then abandoned without pay or documentation.[^30]

This evolution shows that traffickers are highly adaptable, moving into whatever sector offers the highest profit and the lowest risk of detection. The history of the problem is therefore a history of adaptation—as the AU has increased its legal pressure, trafficking syndicates have moved further into the shadows, utilizing technology and complex financial webs to stay one step ahead of the law.

### Examples of Systematic Failure and Success

History provides both warnings and models for the Assembly to consider. The Nguya Case in West Africa serves as a reminder of how corruption can dismantle years of anti-trafficking progress, as high-ranking officials were found to be providing legal cover for a massive child trafficking ring.[^26]

Conversely, the Regional Operational Centre in Khartoum (ROCK) project has shown success in how sharing intelligence across the Horn of Africa can lead to the successful dismantling of transnational gangs. These historical precedents illustrate that the problem is not a lack of laws, but a lack of consistent, transparent enforcement.

The history of trafficking in Africa is a story of a continent caught between its desire for free movement and integration, and the harsh reality of criminal networks that exploit that very openness. Understanding this trajectory is essential for delegates as they seek to craft solutions that are not just reactive, but transformative.[^4]

## Past Actions

The African Union Assembly has long recognized that eradicating human trafficking is a prerequisite for achieving the developmental goals outlined in Agenda 2063. The committee's progress has been measured by its ability to translate high-level continental norms into localized enforcement mechanisms that respect the varying legal traditions of 55 member states. The Assembly has adopted a multi-tiered approach, combining broad policy declarations with targeted regional initiatives designed to address specific hotspots of exploitation. While the Assembly has succeeded in creating a robust legal architecture for human rights protection, its history is also marked by significant hurdles in interstate cooperation and a persistent gap between signing treaties and actually implementing them.[^14]

### Regional Consensus in the Horn

The EU-Horn of Africa Migration Route Initiative, commonly known as the Khartoum Process, stands as a primary example of how the AU has utilized inter-regional partnerships to combat trafficking along the continent's most dangerous migration corridors. Launched in 2014, this process brought together the AU Commission, the European Union, and key transit states such as Sudan, Ethiopia, and Eritrea to address the root causes of trafficking and improve border management.[^1] By providing a forum for intelligence sharing and technical assistance, the Khartoum Process successfully led to the disruption of several major smuggling rings operating between the Horn of Africa and the Mediterranean coast.

Critics have noted, however, that the initiative prioritized containment and border security over the fundamental human rights of victims, leading to a "protection gap" where trafficked individuals were often detained alongside their captors. The success of the Khartoum Process remains a point of debate—it demonstrates the effectiveness of regional cooperation while simultaneously highlighting the risks of securitizing a humanitarian crisis.[^4]

### The Ouagadougou Action Plan

In 2006, the AU Assembly adopted the Ouagadougou Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and Children. This was arguably the most significant continental commitment to the Four Ps strategy: Prevention, Protection, Prosecution, and Partnership. The plan mandated that all member states establish national anti-trafficking coordinating bodies and align their domestic criminal codes with international definitions set forth in the Palermo Protocol. It was hailed as a visionary document that would harmonize the continent's legal response to modern slavery.[^5]

Despite this ambitious vision, the Ouagadougou Action Plan has faced a significant implementation deficit. By 2018, only 34 of the 55 member states had enacted comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation meeting the minimum standards. Many governments cited a lack of technical expertise and insufficient funding as primary barriers. This failure to achieve universal compliance allowed traffickers to simply shift operations to "weak-link" jurisdictions where enforcement was non-existent. The history of the Ouagadougou Action Plan serves as a cautionary tale: a continental position is only as strong as its weakest member state's willingness to enforce it.[^7]

### The Role of AFRIPOL

The establishment of the African Union Mechanism for Police Cooperation (AFRIPOL) in 2014 represented a critical shift toward a more operational and intelligence-driven approach to trafficking. Recognizing that criminal syndicates operate across borders with coordination that national police forces often lack, the AU Assembly designed AFRIPOL to serve as the "INTERPOL of Africa," facilitating real-time exchange of data on trafficking routes and suspect profiles. This move was intended to push the AU beyond rhetoric and toward actual prosecution of high-level criminal kingpins.[^6]

AFRIPOL has achieved notable successes, particularly through its coordination of Operation FLASH-IP and other joint task forces that have led to the rescue of hundreds of victims and the arrest of dozens of traffickers. These operations demonstrated that when member states are willing to share their criminal data, the results can be transformative for regional security. By leveraging modern forensic technology and centralized databases, AFRIPOL has begun to close the impunity gap that traffickers have historically exploited.[^9]

AFRIPOL's efficacy, however, is consistently undermined by the lack of mandatory participation. Many member states remain hesitant to share sensitive security data with a centralized continental body, fearing potential political interference or the exposure of internal corruption. AFRIPOL's funding also remains heavily dependent on external donors, calling into question the long-term sustainability of the mechanism without a dedicated African funding stream.[^13] For delegates, AFRIPOL's history highlights the tension between the necessity of centralized intelligence and the enduring pull of national sovereignty.

## Possible Solutions

### Integrated Border Management (IBM)

The primary obstacle to securing Africa's vast borders is not a lack of physical barriers, but a deficit in technological interoperability. Member states must transition to an Integrated Border Management (IBM) framework centered on a continental Digital Border Ledger (DBL). This system would utilize biometric data such as facial recognition and iris scans to track entries across AU jurisdictions. By harmonizing digital logs, a border guard in Kenya could instantly identify a traveler flagged for suspicious activity in South Africa, effectively eliminating the jurisdictional gaps that traffickers currently exploit.[^25]

The Assembly should also deploy Joint Border Patrol Units (JBPUs) in high-risk corridors like the Sahel. These units, composed of officers from neighboring states under a unified AU mandate, would use shared communications to degrade the agility of criminal networks. For JBPUs to be effective, states must adopt a limited "hot pursuit" protocol, allowing officers to cross borders during active operations without immediate diplomatic clearance.[^21] This level of operational integration is necessary to match the speed of modern syndicates.

Finally, accelerating the African Passport initiative with built-in anti-trafficking safeguards is essential. Verifiable identities allow individuals to move through formal channels, naturally decreasing demand for illicit smugglers. The Assembly must provide technical grants to less-developed states to ensure that the digital divide does not become a security vulnerability.

### Strategic Refugee Protection and the De-Criminalization of Victims

Refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) are the largest recruitment pool for traffickers due to their exclusion from formal labor markets. To address this, the Assembly must advocate for the "self-reliance" model of refugee management, similar to Uganda's policy of granting refugees the right to work and own land. Integrating displaced populations into local economies makes them far less susceptible to false promise recruitment schemes. This approach transforms refugee protection from a host-state burden into a strategic investment in regional stability, ensuring that vulnerable populations contribute to national growth rather than falling into the hands of criminal syndicates.[^15]

To further this protective framework, the Assembly must prioritize establishing AU-monitored Safe Zones and transit centers along migration routes. These sites should serve as "humanitarian hubs," providing centralized legal screening to identify victims before they are moved across borders. Concurrently, the Union must adopt a continent-wide Non-Criminalization Clause ensuring victims are granted temporary residency and legal recourse rather than deportation.[^10] This policy shift is vital—when victims are treated as criminals, they are less likely to cooperate with authorities, thereby shielding traffickers from prosecution.

A Continental Refugee Trust Fund (CRTF) must be created to support host nations in securing displacement sites. Beyond humanitarian aid, these funds should enhance the physical security of IDP camps through improved lighting, perimeter fencing, and deployment of specialized protection officers to prevent these sites from becoming soft targets. Additionally, implementing Mobile Legal Clinics is necessary to provide documentation to remote populations, preventing the statelessness that traffickers frequently use to maintain psychological and legal control over their victims.[^20]

### Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs)

The transparency deficit allows corrupt officials to profit from human trafficking with relative ease. To combat this, the Assembly must mandate independent National Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) to track the illicit money trails generated by this high-profit crime. By utilizing "follow-the-money" tactics and a Continental FIU Network (CFN), the AU can freeze assets instantaneously across borders.[^17] This financial pressure is often more effective than traditional policing, as it targets the economic incentive that drives trafficking networks to expand into new territories.

To address state complicity directly, the Assembly should adopt an AU Anti-Corruption Peer Review mechanism, auditing border agencies for indicators of bribery. States that systematically fail these audits should face targeted diplomatic sanctions or the withholding of AU developmental grants. Such measures provide a powerful incentive for governments to clean up their internal departments and ensure that their officials are not actively facilitating the trade in human lives.[^3]

Finally, the AU must publish anti-trafficking budgets on a public dashboard to allow for civic oversight and establish a Continental Whistleblower Protection Program. Protecting those who report government complicity is the only way to dismantle the internal structures that allow modern slavery to flourish. Transparency is not merely a bureaucratic requirement; it is a defensive tool that ensures the political will of the Assembly is actually translated into the safety and dignity of the African people.[^29]

## Potential Blocs

The response to human trafficking within the African Union is rarely monolithic, as member states are divided by their geographical role in trafficking routes, the stability of their internal governance, and their specific economic priorities. While every nation ostensibly opposes modern slavery, the committee splits into distinct blocs when discussing trade-offs between national sovereignty, border securitization, and human rights protections. These divisions are primarily driven by whether a state acts as a point of origin, a transit hub, or a destination for labor, as well as their willingness to grant the African Union centralized authority over policing and financial monitoring.[^37]

### The Sovereignty-First Securitizers

This bloc consists of states that prioritize national sovereignty and physical border security above all else. For these nations, human trafficking is primarily a border-control failure that threatens state integrity. They often advocate for heavy investment in surveillance, walls, and increased military presence at entry points, viewing trafficking as an extension of irregular migration that must be stopped rather than managed. While they support continental cooperation, they are deeply skeptical of any mechanism—such as a mandatory AFRIPOL database or AU-led hot pursuit protocols—that would allow external actors to access their security data or operate within their borders. Their ideal solutions focus on containment and the physical interception of criminal syndicates.[^8]

### The Humanitarian and Integrationist Advocates

A second group of nations views trafficking as a failure of social protection and regional integration rather than a mere policing issue. This bloc prioritizes the "Protection" pillar of the AU's strategy, advocating for the de-criminalization of victims and the expansion of the self-reliance model for refugees. They argue that the only way to degrade traffickers' influence is to provide migrants and displaced persons with legal avenues to work and live, thereby removing the market demand for illicit smugglers.[^9] These states often support the full implementation of the African Passport and are more willing to cede some sovereignty to build a unified, human-rights-based continental legal framework.

### The Transparency and Accountability Reformers

The third bloc focuses on internal structures of governance, identifying state complicity and corruption as the primary enabler of the trafficking industry. These nations champion solutions centered on financial intelligence and institutional transparency. They advocate for independent audits of border agencies and the creation of a continental network of Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) to track money laundering.[^18] This group is often characterized by a reformist stance, suggesting that no amount of border security will be effective if officials are taking bribes. They are the strongest supporters of AU-led oversight mechanisms and peer-review audits to ensure accountability.

### The Economic Protectionists

Finally, a distinct group of nations remains focused on economic supply chains, particularly regarding forced labor in mining and agricultural sectors. These nations are cautious about international or continental regulations that might interfere with their primary industries or supply chains. While they oppose trafficking, they are wary of supply chain transparency mandates that could impose heavy costs on local businesses or deter foreign investment. Their goal is to find solutions that eradicate exploitation without destabilizing the economic engines that fuel their national development, often preferring voluntary industry standards over strict, legally-binding AU regulations.[^24]
