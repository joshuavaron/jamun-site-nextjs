## Introduction

Start your position paper with a strong introduction that sets the stage for your country's stance.

### Key Questions to Answer

- Why is this topic important?
- How does it affect your nation?
- What is your nation's official stance?

### Example Opening

> "The Federal Republic of Germany recognizes climate change as one of the most pressing challenges facing the international community. As a leading industrial nation and strong advocate for sustainable development, Germany is deeply committed to reducing global carbon emissions and supporting developing nations in their transition to clean energy."

## Paragraph #1: Past UN Actions, Context

This paragraph establishes the background and demonstrates your knowledge of existing efforts.

### Topic Sentence
How have past actions by the UN or other organizations affected your topic?

### Context
Why is your evidence important? What makes these past actions relevant to current discussions?

### Evidence
Cite specific examples:
- Past UN resolutions
- International treaties and agreements
- Actions by regional organizations
- Previous committee decisions

### Analysis
Why does your evidence support your topic sentence? How do past efforts inform what should happen next?

### Concluding Sentence
Connect your evidence to your larger argument about what the committee should do.

### Example

> "The Paris Agreement of 2015 marked a historic step forward in international climate cooperation, establishing the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Germany was among the first nations to ratify this agreement and has consistently exceeded its emissions reduction targets. These past efforts demonstrate that international cooperation can achieve meaningful results, but also highlight the need for stronger commitments from all nations to meet the agreement's ambitious goals."

## Paragraph #2: Intended Actions

This paragraph outlines your country's proposed solutions and policy positions.

### Topic Sentence
How will your country solve the problem? What actions does your delegation support?

### Context
Why will your solution be effective? What makes this approach superior to alternatives?

### Evidence
Support your proposals with:
- Statistics and data
- Historical precedents
- Expert opinions
- Success stories from similar initiatives

### Analysis
How does your solution work in practice? What mechanisms will ensure its success?

### Concluding Sentence
Connect your proposed solution back to your overall argument.

### Example

> "Germany proposes the establishment of a Green Technology Transfer Fund to assist developing nations in adopting renewable energy infrastructure. By contributing $500 million annually and encouraging other developed nations to match this commitment, the international community can accelerate the global transition to clean energy while ensuring that economic development remains accessible to all nations. This approach builds on successful models like the Green Climate Fund while addressing the specific barriers that have limited technology transfer in the past."

## Conclusion

Wrap up your position paper with a clear restatement of your stance and key proposals.

### Elements to Include

- Restate your stance clearly and confidently
- Highlight one or two key parts of your solution
- Express willingness to work with other nations
- End with a forward-looking statement

### Example

> "In conclusion, the Federal Republic of Germany reaffirms its commitment to combating climate change through international cooperation and ambitious action. By supporting the Green Technology Transfer Fund and strengthening the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the international community can make meaningful progress toward a sustainable future. Germany stands ready to work with all willing partners to achieve these goals."
