Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to the African Union at JAMUN! This committee promises to be an engaging and rewarding experience as we explore the important topic of colonial territories and the path to independence.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,

Joshua Varon
