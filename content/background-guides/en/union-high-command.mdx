## Letter from the Chair

Dear Delegates,

Welcome to The American Civil War: Union High Command. You're about to step into the bloodiest conflict in American history, commanding the armies that will determine whether the United States survives as one nation or fractures into two.

It is 1862. The war that everyone thought would last ninety days has already claimed tens of thousands of lives, and there's no end in sight. The Confederate armies have proven far more capable than anyone in Washington anticipated. General McClellan's Peninsula Campaign has stalled. Bull Run was a disaster. And President Lincoln is growing increasingly frustrated with generals who won't fight.

You are the generals, politicians, industrialists, and power brokers who must win this war. Some of you command armies in the field. Others control the factories and railroads that keep those armies supplied. Some are abolitionists pushing to make this a war for freedom. Others just want to restore the Union as it was. Your personal objectives may align perfectly with the war effort, or they may pull you in very different directions.

This is a continuous crisis committee. Victory is not guaranteed. Neither is your career, your reputation, or your life.

Best regards,

The Crisis Dais

## Structure and Mechanics

The American Civil War: Union High Command operates as a continuous crisis committee. This format may be new to some of you, so this section explains the fundamental organization and progression of our sessions.

This committee uses a continuous crisis model throughout every session. The crisis experience splits into two primary arenas: the **front room** and the **back room**. In the front room, you'll participate in typical crisis activities like drafting directives and responding to crisis breaks. The back room centers on the strategic exchange of crisis notes.

Think of the crisis experience as a recurring loop that keeps the committee moving forward. This cycle usually begins with a crisis break, which leads into formal debate, the creation of directives, and finally a vote on those directives. Once a vote concludes, the Crisis Directors and backroom staff will prepare the next crisis break, and the process repeats.

In practical terms, our first session will open with an initial crisis break presenting the committee's starting obstacles. These early challenges will stem from the historical issues detailed later in this guide. As the conference progresses, the updates you receive will largely be shaped by the secret actions delegates take in the backroom. You'll perform these individual actions by sending written notes to the staff.

Delegates are expected to collaborate to address emerging problems through directives—specific action plans intended to resolve particular parts of a crisis. To successfully pass a directive, you'll need to use several key skills: delivering persuasive speeches, engaging in moderated caucus debates, and forming coalitions during unmoderated caucuses. The backroom staff monitors all directives as they're proposed, ensuring that future crisis updates reflect the consequences of the committee's choices.

### Preparing Your Strategy

Before the first session, you should develop a clear objective for your assigned character. Ideally, these goals should be something you can realistically achieve within five sessions, and they don't necessarily have to match the committee's collective mission. You'll use your private notes to put these personal plans into action. We strongly recommend outlining these objectives in your very first crisis note.

Generally, notes should be written in-character and addressed to an appropriate contact—a subordinate, a business associate, or a family member. These messages should provide clear orders for tasks that support your ultimate goal. The more clearly your instructions connect to your long-term plan, the better your Assistant Chairs will be able to support your progress.

During the opening stages of committee, focus on gathering resources and laying the groundwork for your character's ambitions. It's generally wise to establish the necessary funding, logistics, territory, and personnel in your notes before attempting a major move. When requesting these assets, please remain mindful of the historical setting and your character's background. Since we're set in 1861, we can't provide modern technology like GPS—it wouldn't be authentic to the era.

Your aim with your notes should be to influence the front room by triggering as many crisis breaks as possible. A powerful way to achieve this is by ensuring your private actions are significant enough to disrupt the committee's status quo and force a public response.

We're excited to see how you manage these systems and leverage your unique influence. We encourage you to be inventive in tackling the obstacles ahead. Before the conference begins, we suggest visiting the MUNUC website to review standard terminology and strategies for success. If you find any part of this process confusing, please feel free to ask for clarification.

## History of the Problem

The American Civil War wasn't a sudden explosion—it was the culmination of nearly a century of friction. Since the signing of the Constitution, the United States had effectively been two nations living under one flag. While the founders hoped that time would heal regional divides, the mid-19th century instead saw those cracks widen into a chasm. By 1861, the North and South were separated by vastly different economic systems, social structures, and visions for the future of the republic.[^14]

### Two Americas

By the 1840s, the Northern and Southern states had taken entirely different paths toward progress. The North was undergoing an Industrial Revolution. Cities like New York, Boston, and Chicago became hubs of manufacturing and trade. Thousands of miles of railroad tracks connected the Atlantic coast to the growing Midwest. This economy relied on free labor—the idea that workers should be paid for their work and free to change jobs.[^15] This fostered a society that valued formal education, urban growth, and technological innovation.

In contrast, the South remained a rural, agrarian society. Its economy was dominated by King Cotton, a crop exported in massive quantities to textile mills in England and the North. This entire economic system was built upon the backs of enslaved African Americans. For the Southern planter class, wealth wasn't measured in factories or bank accounts, but in land and human property.[^10] This reliance on slavery created a rigid social hierarchy where a small number of wealthy plantation owners held most of the political power, and industrial progress was often viewed with suspicion as a threat to their traditional way of life.

### Abolitionism and Southern Defense

The economic divide was significant, but the most explosive issue was the morality and legality of slavery. In the North, a vibrant abolitionist movement began to grow. Influenced by the Second Great Awakening—a period of intense religious revival—many Northerners came to see slavery as a national sin. Books like Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* brought the horrors of the institution into Northern living rooms, turning millions of ordinary citizens against the South.[^38]

Southern leaders responded with a "Positive Good" defense of slavery. They argued that the institution was protected by the Constitution and necessary for the stability of their society. They also began championing the doctrine of States' Rights, arguing that the federal government had no authority to tell a state what to do with its internal property.[^31] This led to the Nullification Crisis of 1832, where South Carolina attempted to declare federal laws null and void—a dangerous preview of the secession to come.

### The Struggle for the West

The tension between these two worlds was most visible whenever the United States expanded westward. Every new territory gained—from the Louisiana Purchase to the lands won in the Mexican-American War—raised the same question: Would this land be free or slave?

For decades, Congress tried to maintain a delicate balance. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 drew a line across the map, decreeing that all new states north of that line would be free. However, as the nation grew, this line became impossible to maintain. The Compromise of 1850 attempted to settle the issue by allowing California to join as a free state while strengthening the Fugitive Slave Act—a law that forced Northerners to help capture escaped slaves.[^26] This law deeply angered the North, as it brought the reality of slavery directly to their doorsteps.

The final collapse of compromise came with the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. This law introduced the idea of Popular Sovereignty, allowing settlers in new territories to vote on whether to allow slavery. The result? A miniature civil war known as Bleeding Kansas, as pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers flooded the territory to fight for control. The violence in Kansas proved that the legal systems of the United States were no longer capable of containing regional anger.[^23]

### The Fugitive Slave Act

The Compromise of 1850 was intended to calm the waters, but it contained a poison pill that radicalized the North: the Fugitive Slave Act. Before this law, slavery often felt like a Southern problem that Northerners could ignore. The new law changed that. It required citizens to assist in the capture of runaway slaves and denied accused runaways the right to a jury trial.[^30]

This turned Northern cities into battlegrounds. In Boston and Philadelphia, Vigilance Committees formed to protect Black residents from slave catchers. Ordinary Northerners watched as their neighbors were dragged away in chains by federal marshals. This law effectively nationalized slavery, forcing the North to become an active participant in an institution they detested.[^38] The legal system was no longer a neutral arbiter—it had become a tool for Southern interests, leading many to believe that the laws of the land were no longer worthy of respect.

### The Death of Legal Compromise

In 1857, the conflict reached the highest court in the land. Dred Scott, an enslaved man who had been taken by his owner into free territories, sued for his freedom. The Supreme Court's ruling, led by Chief Justice Roger Taney, was a legal earthquake. The Court ruled that Black people, whether enslaved or free, could never be citizens of the United States. More importantly, it declared that Congress had no power to ban slavery in any federal territory.[^17]

This decision effectively struck down every compromise that had kept the peace for forty years. It suggested that there was no such thing as a "Free State," because a slave owner could move his property anywhere without consequence. For the North, the Dred Scott decision proved that a "Slave Power Conspiracy" had taken over the government.[^34] The hope that the law could peacefully solve the issue of slavery died with this ruling, leaving only the possibility of political or physical struggle.

### John Brown and the Radicalization of Violence

As legal options faded, violence took their place. In 1859, a radical abolitionist named John Brown led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. His goal: spark a massive slave uprising that would destroy the institution from the inside out. The raid failed and Brown was executed, but the event sent shockwaves through the nation.[^25]

To the South, John Brown was the ultimate nightmare: a Northern terrorist funded by wealthy abolitionists, coming to murder them in their beds. To many in the North, Brown became a martyr who died for a holy cause. The destruction of civil discourse was now complete. Both sides began to organize militias and arm themselves. The question was no longer *if* blood would be shed, but *when*.[^20] By the time the 1860 election arrived, the United States was already an armed camp waiting for a spark.

### The Election of 1860

The breaking point was the rise of the Republican Party, a new political group dedicated to stopping the expansion of slavery. When the Republican candidate, Abraham Lincoln, won the Presidency in 1860, the South felt they had lost their voice in the Union. Lincoln didn't win a single Southern state, yet he was now the leader of the nation.[^6]

To the Southern states, this was the final insult. Led by South Carolina, seven states quickly voted to leave the Union before Lincoln was even inaugurated. They argued that because the Union was a voluntary compact of states, they had the right to leave whenever they wished. Lincoln, however, believed the Union was perpetual and could never be broken. When Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter in April 1861, the debate ended and the war began.[^27] Four more states joined the Confederacy, and the Union was forced to mobilize for a struggle that would determine if a democratic nation could survive its own internal divisions.

## Statement of the Problem: A Nation in Chaos

The committee convenes in the final months of 1861, a time of profound existential dread for the Union. The initial ninety-day optimism has been shattered by the bloody reality of the First Battle of Bull Run. What was meant to be a swift suppression of a rebellion has devolved into a massive, continental war for which the North is fundamentally unprepared.[^21] The Union High Command faces a multifaceted crisis that threatens to dissolve the United States before the year is out.

### The Siege of Washington

The Union's most immediate and terrifying threat is the geographic isolation of the capital. Washington D.C. is a Northern city located in Southern territory. To its south lies Virginia, the powerhouse of the Confederacy; to its north lies Maryland, a slave state whose population is deeply divided. In the weeks following the start of the war, pro-Confederate mobs in Baltimore attacked Union troops and destroyed railroad bridges, effectively severing the capital's connection to the loyal North.[^15]

The siege of Washington isn't just a military problem—it's a psychological one. If the capital is captured, European powers will likely recognize the Confederacy as a legitimate nation. If Maryland secedes, Washington will be an island in a Confederate sea. President Lincoln has taken the extraordinary and controversial step of suspending habeas corpus along the Maryland transit routes, allowing the military to arrest suspected saboteurs without trial.[^7] This committee must decide how to maintain the loyalty of the Border States while ensuring the capital remains a functional center of government.

### Funding a Total War

Modern war is an industrial machine that consumes money as fast as it consumes gunpowder. By late 1861, the Union Treasury is effectively empty. The federal government has historically relied on modest tariffs and land sales for revenue, but it's now spending over one million dollars a day to outfit an army of 500,000 men. Private banks are beginning to refuse to lend money to the government, fearing that the Union will lose and never pay them back.[^3]

The collapse of the national treasury would mean the immediate end of the war effort. Soldiers who aren't paid will desert; manufacturers who aren't paid will stop producing rifles. Secretary Chase is proposing radical measures: the creation of a national banking system and the issuance of "Greenbacks"—paper currency not backed by gold. This is a terrifying prospect for a nation that has always relied on hard money.[^19] The High Command must find a way to finance the war without destroying the Northern economy through hyperinflation or public panic.

### The Trent Affair

The Union is currently facing a two-front war: one in the woods of Virginia and one in the courts of Europe. The Confederacy knows it cannot win a war of attrition against the North's superior population; it needs the British Navy to break the Union blockade. The Trent Affair—the Union's seizure of Confederate envoys from a British mail steamer—has brought the United Kingdom to the brink of declaring war against the United States.[^10]

Great Britain has thousands of troops in Canada and the world's most powerful navy. If they enter the war to protect their maritime rights, the Union blockade will be shattered, Southern cotton will flow to Europe, and Confederate coffers will be filled with British gold. The High Command must find a way to de-escalate with London without appearing to surrender to British bullying, all while preventing the South from gaining the international legitimacy it craves.[^40]

### A Fragmented Infrastructure

The North has more factories, more people, and more railroads than the South, but as of 1861, these advantages exist only on paper. The Union's infrastructure is a disorganized mess. Railroad companies use different gauges (track widths), meaning a train from New York cannot travel directly into the Midwest without unloading and reloading its cargo. The telegraph system is owned by private companies that often prioritize business messages over military orders.[^38]

The problem is one of central coordination. The Union army is currently dying of disease in camps because the medical department is understaffed and undersupplied. Soldiers are receiving rotten food and defective weapons from corrupt contractors. To win, the High Command must seize control of the nation's industrial heart. This means creating a unified command for railroads and telegraphs, rooting out corruption in the war department, and transforming a collection of volunteer militias into a disciplined, modernized military force. Failure means the North's vast resources will simply rot in warehouses while the army starves in the field.[^17]

## Portfolio Powers

Below are the detailed profiles for the members of the Union High Command. Each delegate possesses unique Portfolio Powers that reflect their historical influence and specialized resources.

### Edwin M. Stanton (Secretary of War)

Stanton is the relentless engine of the Union war effort. Known for his abrasive personality and iron will, he took over a War Department riddled with corruption and inefficiency. In this committee, Stanton's primary power lies in his control over the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps and the War Office. He has the unique ability to intercept military communications and can influence the promotion or dismissal of generals in the field.

His goal is to transform the volunteer militias into a professional army while ensuring that military leaders remain strictly subordinate to civilian authority. He's also a staunch advocate for aggressive military action and has little patience for cautious commanders. Stanton must navigate the politics of the cabinet while ruthlessly purging the military of those he deems incompetent or disloyal.[^31]

### William H. Seward (Secretary of State)

Seward is the Union's chief architect of foreign policy and Lincoln's closest advisor. A master of brinksmanship, he must prevent European intervention while maintaining American honor. In committee, Seward controls the Union's diplomatic corps and a network of secret agents operating in London and Paris. He has the power to issue passports, negotiate secret treaties, and manage the Secret Service Fund for international bribery or propaganda.

His objective is to ensure that the Confederacy never gains formal recognition from Britain or France. He must also manage the Trent Affair to avoid war with England without appearing weak to the American public. Seward's influence extends to the President's ear, making him a central hub for all high-level strategy.[^22]

### Salmon P. Chase (Secretary of the Treasury)

Chase is tasked with the impossible: funding a war that costs millions per day with an empty treasury. A tall, dignified man with presidential ambitions, Chase is a radical in his politics but a conservative in his banking. In committee, Chase controls the purse strings. He has the power to propose new taxes, manage the minting of coins, and oversee the issuance of the new Greenback currency.

His primary goal is to maintain the Union's credit rating and prevent an economic collapse. He must convince Northern banks to continue lending to the government and manage the internal logistics of revenue collection. Chase often clashes with other cabinet members over the cost of their projects, making him the committee's essential gatekeeper of resources.[^17]

### Gideon Welles (Secretary of the Navy)

Affectionately (or mockingly) called "Father Neptune," Welles is the quiet, methodical architect of the Union's naval blockade. Despite his lack of naval experience, he has overseen a massive expansion of the fleet. In committee, Welles controls all naval movements, the construction of ironclad warships, and the implementation of the Anaconda Plan. He has the power to seize ports, authorize letters of marque for privateers, and manage the naval department's vast budget.

His goal is to starve the South of supplies and prevent Confederate commerce raiders from destroying Northern trade. He's particularly focused on the race for ironclad technology, fearing that the South might build a ship that can single-handedly destroy the wooden Union blockade.[^12]

### Edward Bates (Attorney General)

Bates is the Union's legal shield, responsible for justifying the extraordinary measures taken during the war. A conservative Missourian, he provides the legal cover for Lincoln's controversial decisions. In committee, Bates manages the federal judicial system and the U.S. Marshals. He has the unique power to authorize the suspension of habeas corpus, oversee the arrest of suspected spies, and manage the legal aspects of confiscating Confederate property.

His objective is to maintain law and order in the North while ensuring that the government's actions remain (at least technically) constitutional. He must balance the needs of military security with the protection of civil liberties—a task that often places him at the center of the committee's most heated ethical debates.[^7]

### Frederick Douglass (Abolitionist Leader)

Douglass is the moral conscience of the Union and the most famous Black man in America. An escaped slave turned orator, he believes the war is meaningless unless it results in the total destruction of slavery. In committee, Douglass possesses immense social influence. He can mobilize the abolitionist press, influence Northern public opinion through speaking tours, and coordinate with Black communities across the North.

His power lies in his ability to pressure the Cabinet into making the war a crusade for freedom. His goal is to authorize the recruitment of Black soldiers and secure a promise of full emancipation. He must use his platform to ensure that the Union does not settle for a peace with slavery to end the fighting quickly.[^7]

### Jay Cooke (Investment Banker)

Cooke is the Financier of the Union, a man who believes that patriotism can be a profitable investment. When the government couldn't get loans from big banks, Cooke took the war to the people. In committee, Cooke manages the sale of Five-Twenty war bonds. He has the power to raise massive amounts of private capital by marketing bonds to ordinary citizens.

His goal is to ensure the Treasury never runs dry by building a nationwide network of sales agents. He can also influence the stock market and provide private loans to other delegates' projects. Cooke's success is tied to Union victories; if the army loses, his bonds become worthless, making him one of the most motivated supporters of aggressive military spending.[^1]

### Herman Haupt (Director of Military Railroads)

Haupt is a logistical genius who can build a bridge out of "cornstalks and beanpoles" in a matter of days. He's responsible for the movement of every soldier and every biscuit in the Union army. In committee, Haupt controls the U.S. Military Railroads (USMRR). He has the power to seize private railroad lines for military use, prioritize shipments, and rapidly repair destroyed infrastructure.

His objective is to ensure that Union armies are never stranded without supplies. He can move thousands of troops across the map in a single turn, making him the king of movement. Haupt must constantly battle with railroad tycoons and cautious generals to keep the tracks clear and the trains running on time.[^4]

### Andrew Carnegie (Superintendent of Military Telegraphs)

At only 26 years old, Carnegie is a rising star in the world of technology and management. He's the right-hand man to Tom Scott at the War Department, focusing on the nerves of the Union. In committee, Carnegie manages the physical infrastructure of the telegraph lines. He has the power to build new lines, intercept encoded messages, and "accidentally" delay communications between the front room and the back room.

His goal is to ensure the Union has a technological edge over the South. He's also a master of efficiency, looking for ways to cut costs and streamline communication. Carnegie is ambitious and always looking for ways to expand his influence into the steel and transportation industries.[^9]

### Thaddeus Stevens (Radical Republican)

Stevens is the "Old Commoner," a fierce Congressman who hates slavery with a burning passion. He chairs the Ways and Means Committee and dominates the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War. In committee, Stevens has the power to launch congressional investigations into military failures and can block or approve government spending. He can summon generals to testify and use public hearings to ruin the careers of conservative or soft commanders.

His goal is a Total War policy that includes the seizure of Southern lands and the immediate arming of enslaved people. Stevens is the political muscle behind the radical movement, and he isn't afraid to use the threat of a congressional audit to get his way.[^19]

### Allan Pinkerton (Head of Intelligence)

Pinkerton is the Union's primary spy-master, though his methods are often as theatrical as they are effective. He founded the Pinkerton National Detective Agency and saved Lincoln from an assassination plot in Baltimore. In committee, Pinkerton manages a network of Secret Service agents. He has the power to conduct counter-espionage, plant false information in Confederate circles, and provide intelligence reports on enemy strength.

His goal is to protect the President and uncover Southern plots within Washington D.C. However, Pinkerton is known for drastically overestimating enemy numbers, which can lead to over-caution in the military. He must decide whether to provide accurate data or padded numbers to influence the committee's strategy.[^29]

### Elizabeth Van Lew (Union Spy)

Operating under the codename "Crazy Bet," Van Lew is the leader of a high-stakes spy ring in the Confederate capital of Richmond. A wealthy Virginian who remained loyal to the Union, she uses her social status to gather secrets from the highest levels of the Southern government. In committee, Van Lew provides deep cover intelligence. She can smuggle messages out of Richmond, help Union prisoners escape from Libby Prison, and plant agents inside the Confederate White House.

Her goal is to disrupt the Confederacy from within by providing the Union High Command with the CSA's military plans. Her life is constantly at risk, making her the committee's most vital and vulnerable source of information from enemy territory.[^26]

### Thomas Nast (Political Cartoonist)

Nast is the Union's most powerful influencer. His drawings in *Harper's Weekly* are seen by millions and can turn an obscure general into a national hero or a traitor. In committee, Nast manages public morale. He has the power to launch media campaigns that increase recruitment, shame war-profiteers, or drum up support for controversial policies like the draft.

His goal is to maintain Northern will to fight during the dark days of defeat. Nast's cartoons are especially effective at reaching the illiterate and immigrant populations. He can also target other delegates in the room—a single caricature from Nast can make a cabinet member untouchable or politically dead.[^20]

### James Gordon Bennett Sr. (Publisher of the NY Herald)

Bennett is the king of the Penny Press and controls the most widely read newspaper in the world. He's not a fan of Lincoln or the Republicans, but he loves a good story. In committee, Bennett controls the media narrative. He has the power to leak secrets to the public, print sensationalist headlines that trigger riots, and send embedded reporters to the front lines.

His goal is to maximize his newspaper's circulation and influence. He can be a valuable ally if paid or courted, but if he feels ignored, he can turn the public against the High Command by printing stories of military incompetence or government corruption.[^40]

### Clara Barton (Humanitarian & Nurse)

Barton is a pioneer of modern nursing who realized that soldiers weren't just dying from bullets, but from lack of supplies. She operates independently of the slow-moving Sanitary Commission. In committee, Barton manages field logistics for the wounded. She has the power to mobilize private donation networks and can provide medical buffs to Union armies, allowing them to recover from losses faster.

Her goal is to modernize the army's medical department and ensure that supplies reach the front lines during the "Golden Hour" after a battle. She can also use her reputation as a saint to influence public opinion and shame officials who block her efforts.[^15]

### Mary Todd Lincoln (First Lady)

Mary Todd Lincoln is one of the most influential people in Washington. She's the social gatekeeper of the capital and manages the President's personal schedule. In committee, Mary Todd Lincoln manages high society and internal access. She has the power to grant or deny private meetings with the President, host lobbying salons, and gather gossip from the wives of generals and diplomats.

Her goal is to protect her husband's legacy and ensure the Union wins while maintaining her own social standing. She's also a channel for the Border State perspective, as her own family is divided by the war, giving her unique insight into the Southern mindset.[^4]

### Professor Thaddeus Lowe (Chief Aeronaut)

Lowe is a man of science who believes the future of war is in the sky. He convinced Lincoln to form the Union Army Balloon Corps by sending a telegraph from a balloon hovering over the White House. In committee, Lowe manages aerial reconnaissance. He has the power to map out enemy fortifications from above and can provide line-of-sight bonuses for Union artillery.

His goal is to prove the military value of experimental technology. He must constantly petition the War Department for hydrogen gas and specialized wagons, making him a frequent requester of Stanton and Carnegie's resources.[^18]

### Joseph Henry (Secretary of the Smithsonian)

Henry is the most respected scientist in America and a personal friend of the President. He turned the Smithsonian into a war research lab. In committee, Henry manages scientific innovation. He has the power to develop and test new weapons, such as calcium lights for night fighting, early submarines, and chemical signaling systems.

His goal is to give the Union a technological edge through the application of physics and engineering. He's a man of ethics and must decide whether to develop terrible weapons like landmines ("infernal machines") that might win the war but damage the nation's moral character.[^31]

### Sojourner Truth (Abolitionist & Activist)

Truth is a traveler and a truth-teller who uses her powerful presence to gather and spread information. She works with the Contraband camps—areas where escaped slaves seek refuge behind Union lines. In committee, Truth manages humanitarian intelligence. She has the power to gather information from people the South ignores: the enslaved population.

Her goal is to coordinate the Underground Railroad to act as a sabotage network and to ensure that the Contrabands are treated with dignity and used effectively for the Union cause. She's a master of gathering news from the grapevine, providing the committee with information about Southern morale and logistics that traditional spies might miss.[^36]
