## History of the Committee

The European Union (EU) is a unique political and economic partnership between 27 European countries that together cover much of the continent. While the organization is widely recognized today for its single currency and shared parliament, its origins were far more modest, born from a desire to ensure lasting peace following the devastation of World War II.

In 1952, six founding nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) created the European Coal and Steel Community. This agreement was designed to manage the very industries necessary for war, so that conflict between neighbors would become not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible. Over the following decades, this economic cooperation expanded into a broader union, officially adopting the name "European Union" in 1993 to reflect its growing role in social, environmental, and security policies.[^9]

As the EU grew in size and influence, its members realized that a truly borderless internal market required a new approach to security. In the mid-1970s, as international crime and terrorism began crossing national lines more frequently, European ministers began meeting informally to coordinate their law enforcement efforts. These early discussions eventually evolved into what is now known as the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) configuration of the EU. This branch of the Union is responsible for managing the "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice."[^3] Unlike the EU's economic committees, which focus on trade, the JHA focuses on the rights of citizens to move freely within Europe while maintaining a high level of security at the Union's shared external borders.[^4]

Today, the European Union committee operates as a powerful decision-making body where member states negotiate laws that affect over 450 million people. The committee's work in border security and refugee management is particularly vital because of the **Schengen Area**—a zone where internal border checks have been largely abolished.[^4] Because a person can travel from one EU country to another without showing a passport, the security of the Union's outer perimeter becomes a collective responsibility. The committee must balance the humanitarian obligation to protect refugees with the practical necessity of maintaining stable and secure borders, ensuring that the Union remains a safe haven for its residents and a responsible actor on the global stage.[^15]

## Statement of the Problem

The European Union currently faces a dual crisis that threatens the very foundation of its unified identity: a logistical breakdown at its external borders and a deepening political divide between its member states.

At the heart of this problem is the sheer scale of irregular migration and the specialized infrastructure required to manage it. In the first ten months of 2025 alone, over 152,000 irregular entries were detected across the EU's external borders.[^26] While this represents a decrease from previous years, the pressure remains concentrated on a few critical hotspots that lack resources to handle the volume. These locations—primarily along the Mediterranean and Balkan routes—have become the front lines of a logistical struggle where systems designed to process, house, and protect individuals are frequently pushed beyond their breaking points.[^25]

### The Fragile Perimeter

The security of the European Union relies on a strong external border, but the physical and digital infrastructure currently in place is increasingly viewed as insufficient for modern challenges. The primary hurdle is not merely the number of people arriving, but the speed and unpredictability of these arrivals.

In the Central Mediterranean, the busiest route in 2025, nearly 59,000 arrivals were recorded in less than a year, with Libya serving as a primary departure point.[^7] When thousands of individuals arrive at a single maritime or land entry point in a matter of days, local reception facilities often collapse under the weight of demand.

This infrastructure pressure shows up most clearly in the **hotspot approach**, where designated centers are meant to provide immediate medical care, identification, and fingerprinting. However, these facilities are often chronically overcrowded. On the island of Crete, for instance, detections of irregular crossings surged by over 270% in 2025 compared to the previous year.[^8] Such dramatic spikes leave local authorities without enough beds, clean water, or processing staff.

This creates a bottleneck effect: if the external border cannot process people quickly, they cannot be moved to other locations, leading to dangerous levels of congestion. The digital infrastructure used to track these movements—such as the Eurodac database—requires constant updating and universal cooperation from all member states, something that's difficult to achieve when the system is already overwhelmed.[^19]

### Sovereignty vs. Solidarity

Beyond the physical borders, the EU is struggling with an internal solidarity crisis. Under current EU law (specifically the **Dublin Regulation**), the country where an asylum seeker first sets foot is generally responsible for processing their claim.[^10] This creates a massive imbalance: a handful of frontline states in the south and east bear a disproportionate share of the legal, financial, and logistical burden simply because of their geography. Meanwhile, destination states in northern and central Europe, where many refugees eventually hope to settle, face **secondary movements**—people moving between EU countries without permission.[^24]

This imbalance has led to a breakdown in trust. Frontline states argue that they are being abandoned by the rest of the Union to act as Europe's border guards, while destination states complain that frontline countries are not properly registering arrivals, allowing people to move deeper into the EU unchecked.[^11]

This friction has pushed some nations to take the drastic step of reintroducing temporary checks at their internal borders—borders meant to be invisible within the Schengen Area. By late 2025, at least ten countries, including Germany and France, had reinstalled internal checkpoints. These actions signal a retreat from the borderless ideal and highlight the fear that if the external border cannot be secured collectively, individual nations will return to a fortress mentality, building walls against their own neighbors.[^13]

### The Price of Institutional Strain

When logistical systems fail, the primary casualty is the efficiency and fairness of the asylum process. As systems become overstretched, the time it takes to process an application grows longer. In many member states, backlogs of claims have grown so large that individuals may wait years for a decision on their status.[^10] This limbo period places immense pressure on social services and local economies, as nations must provide housing and support for individuals who are legally unable to work while their cases are pending.[^21]

The strain on border security often forces authorities to prioritize enforcement over humanitarian aid. Organized criminal networks frequently exploit these institutional gaps, using powerful speedboats and complex smuggling routes to bypass traditional patrols. As the EU increases its spending on border technology and Frontex (the European Border and Coast Guard Agency) deployments, there's a constant risk that the fundamental rights of those seeking protection will be sidelined.

The challenge for the committee is not just to build stronger fences, but to create a system that is robust enough to handle the logistics of migration without sacrificing the core values of dignity and human rights that the Union was built to uphold.[^20]

### The Crisis of Processing and Returns

Even when an individual is successfully registered at the border, the logistical nightmare does not end. It merely shifts from the physical perimeter to the administrative and judicial offices of the Union.

The EU is currently facing a massive backlog of asylum applications that has reached historical highs. In early 2025, nearly one million cases were pending across the Union, with some individuals waiting over 20 months for a primary decision. This administrative freeze is a core part of the problem because it prevents the efficient allocation of resources. While cases are pending, member states are legally obligated to provide housing, healthcare, and social support. When the system is clogged, these services are strained to the point of failure, leading to the creation of sprawling, unofficial tent cities in major European hubs.[^18]

The crisis is further compounded by the low rate of returns—the number of individuals successfully deported whose asylum claims have been rejected. On average, only about 20% to 30% of people ordered to leave the EU are actually returned to their home countries.[^1] This failure creates a vast shadow population: hundreds of thousands of people living within the EU without legal status, unable to work legally and vulnerable to exploitation by organized crime.[^21]

The inability to execute returns is not just a security failure; it's a diplomatic one. Many countries of origin refuse to readmit their citizens, and the EU has struggled to use its economic leverage to compel cooperation.[^15] Without a functional system for returns, the border becomes a one-way valve, and the logistical pressure on the Union continues to build indefinitely, undermining the public's trust in the government's ability to manage its own territory.[^27]

## History of the Problem

The historical trajectory of European border management is a narrative of shifting priorities: from the optimistic removal of internal walls in the 1990s to the construction of sophisticated technological and political barriers in the 2020s. Understanding how the European Union arrived at its current state of crisis requires looking at how original treaties failed to anticipate modern migration volumes and how the "Schengen" dream of a borderless continent became tethered to the reality of a thick external perimeter.[^15]

### Repeated Stalemates

The legal foundation for the current problem was laid with the 1990 Schengen Convention and the subsequent Dublin Convention. These agreements were born in a geopolitical era of relative stability, where migration was viewed as a manageable, low-volume administrative task rather than a systemic challenge.[^15]

The Dublin Regulation, which established the "first country of entry" rule, was intended to create a clear, orderly process for determining which nation was responsible for an asylum seeker. But even in its earliest iterations, the protocol suffered from a critical design flaw: it assumed that all member states shared an equal capacity to process claims and that arrivals would be geographically distributed in a balanced way.[^17]

Throughout the early 2000s, this assumption was repeatedly proven false. As the Arab Spring and various regional instabilities began to push more people toward Europe, frontline states began to call for a **binding relocation protocol**—a system that would automatically move asylum seekers from overwhelmed border nations to the rest of the EU.[^26]

These proposals were met with repeated stalemates. Wealthier, inland nations argued that such a protocol would act as a "pull factor," encouraging more people to make the dangerous journey to Europe, while also infringing on their national sovereignty to decide who enters their territory. This lack of a unified response forced frontline states to act independently, leading to the creation of the first hotspots and a patchwork of local policies that failed to address the root of the logistical strain.[^31]

### The Evolution of Border Technology

As political negotiations stalled, the European Union increasingly turned to technology as a solution for its security concerns. The history of the problem is marked by the gradual digitalization of the border, moving from manual passport stamps to complex biometric databases. This technological shift was accelerated by the 2015 migration crisis, which exposed the EU's inability to track who was entering the Schengen Area.[^17]

One of the most significant developments was the creation of the **Entry/Exit System (EES)**. Planned over several years and implemented to replace manual passport stamping, the EES is an automated IT system that registers non-EU nationals each time they cross an external border.[^18] It records the person's name, type of travel document, fingerprints, and facial images.

While the EES was pitched as a tool to fight terrorism and catch overstayers, its history is also one of logistical complexity.[^25] Implementing such high-tech systems requires massive investments in hardware at every airport, seaport, and land crossing. The reliance on **Eurodac**—the EU's biometric database for asylum seekers—has historically been a point of contention. Many member states failed to upload data consistently, leading to digital holes in the Union's security net that allowed individuals to move across the continent undetected.[^19]

### Moving the Border Beyond Europe

Another historical pillar of the EU's border strategy has been the policy of **externalization**: the practice of reaching agreements with non-EU countries to stop migration before it reaches European soil.

This approach began in earnest with the EU-Turkey Statement of 2016. In exchange for billions of euros in aid and political concessions, Turkey agreed to take back irregular migrants who crossed into Greece and to strengthen its own border patrols.[^20]

This deal-making model became the blueprint for the EU's interaction with its neighbors. Similar agreements were later pursued with countries like Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt.[^12] While these deals successfully reduced arrivals in the short term, they have been criticized for being ethically and legally fragile.

By paying third-party countries to act as gatekeepers, the EU arguably outsourced its humanitarian responsibilities to nations with questionable human rights records. This trend has created a paradox: the EU's border security is now heavily dependent on the cooperation of foreign governments—giving those nations significant political leverage over European affairs.[^10]

### A Final Attempt at Consensus

The most recent chapter in this history is the **New Pact on Migration and Asylum**, proposed in 2020 and finalized for implementation in 2026. This pact represents a decade of lessons learned from the failures of the Dublin system.

It introduces a **mandatory solidarity mechanism**, where member states must either accept relocated asylum seekers or pay a financial contribution to those countries that do.[^11] It also legalizes the use of **Return Hubs**—facilities located outside or at the very edge of the EU where individuals whose asylum claims are rejected can be held before deportation.[^19]

The history of the New Pact is one of intense compromise. It seeks to satisfy the security demands of the north while addressing the logistical complaints of the south. Critics, however, argue that the Pact focuses too heavily on border procedures—speedy, high-pressure screenings at the border—which could lead to more detention and fewer legal safeguards.[^24]

As the committee looks toward the future, it must decide whether the New Pact is a genuine solution to the historical stalemates of the past or simply another layer of bureaucracy added to a fundamentally broken system.[^5]

## Past Actions

The European Union has spent the better part of the last decade attempting to patch the holes in its security architecture through unprecedented operational expansions and legislative reforms. While the Union has historically preferred soft power and diplomatic negotiation, rising pressure at its borders has forced a shift toward more direct (and at times controversial) physical and digital interventions.

By analyzing these past actions, delegates can identify which strategies have successfully mitigated logistical strain and which have only deepened the political divide between member states.

### The Standing Corps

One of the most significant past actions is the transformation of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, or **Frontex**. Originally a small coordination office with no equipment of its own, Frontex was dramatically reorganized in 2019 following the chaos of the 2015 crisis.

The EU created a **Standing Corps**—a permanent group of up to 10,000 border guards who are directly employed by the EU and can be deployed at a moment's notice to any hotspot or national border in distress.[^16] This marked the first time the EU had a uniformed service with the power to exercise executive authority, such as checking passports and patrolling land borders alongside national police.

In addition to land-based deployments, the EU launched major maritime operations in the Mediterranean to combat human smuggling. **Operation Sophia** (2015–2020) and its successor, **Operation Irini**, focused on intercepting vessels used by traffickers and enforcing arms embargos.[^26] While these missions were successful in destroying hundreds of smuggling boats, they also highlighted a persistent legal problem: once people are rescued at sea, they must be brought to a safe port. Because member states could not agree on which port should accept them, these naval missions were often criticized for prioritizing security over the humanitarian obligation to rescue those in distress.

Today, Frontex remains the EU's most powerful tool for on-the-ground enforcement, though it continues to face scrutiny from the European Parliament regarding its oversight and its role in pushbacks at the Greek and Balkan borders.[^27]

### The Third-Country Model

Recognizing that its internal resources were being overwhelmed, the EU began a policy of externalizing its borders—moving the work of stopping migration into the territories of neighboring countries.

The landmark action in this regard was the **EU-Turkey Statement of 2016**, where the Union provided over €6 billion in aid to help Turkey manage millions of Syrian refugees within its own borders in exchange for Turkey preventing departures to Greece.[^28] This Statement essentially turned Turkey into a buffer zone, significantly reducing the number of people crossing the Aegean Sea almost overnight.[^24]

Building on the Turkey model, the EU has recently signed "Strategic and Comprehensive Partnerships" with Tunisia (2023) and Egypt (2024).[^29] Under these deals, the EU provides hundreds of millions of euros to modernize the coast guards of these nations and improve their border surveillance. These actions are designed to stop the logistical crisis before it even reaches the Schengen Area.

These past actions, however, have been highly controversial. Human rights organizations have documented that these external partners often use aggressive tactics, and the EU has been accused of outsourcing its asylum responsibilities to countries where refugees may not be safe. For delegates, the success of these partnerships is measured by the drop in arrivals—but the price of this security remains a central point of debate.[^26]

### Financial Engineering

Behind every fence and patrol boat is a massive financial commitment. To coordinate these efforts, the EU established the **Integrated Border Management Fund (IBMF)** for the 2021–2027 period, with a budget of over €6.2 billion.[^31] This fund is crucial because it allows the EU to steer the border policies of its member states. Instead of telling a country how to guard its border, the EU provides grants for specific priorities, such as purchasing advanced thermal-imaging drones, building high-tech control centers, and installing automated Smart Gates at airports.[^27]

The IBMF also funds the development of **Interoperability**—a massive technical project aimed at linking all EU security databases (like Eurodac, the Visa Information System, and the EES) into a single search portal. This digital action is intended to ensure that no person can enter the EU under one identity and apply for asylum in another country under a different one.[^29]

While these financial and digital actions have created a much more legible border for security forces, they have also created new logistical challenges. Smaller, frontline nations often struggle to maintain the expensive equipment purchased with EU funds, leading to a technological gap where some borders are highly advanced while others remain vulnerable to simple bypasses by smuggling networks.[^4]

## Possible Solutions

### AI-Enhanced Surveillance

A primary technical solution under consideration is the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to manage border logistics with machine-speed precision. Currently, border agencies rely on reactive data: they respond after a crossing has already been detected.

A transition toward **predictive modeling** would involve using AI to analyze satellite imagery, weather patterns, and social media trends in departure countries to anticipate where and when a large group of migrants might arrive.[^9] By predicting these surges 48 to 72 hours in advance, the EU could move the Standing Corps and medical supplies to the specific hotspot before it becomes overcrowded, effectively preventing the logistical collapse of local infrastructure.

The implementation of AI at the border, however, raises significant legal and ethical questions. One proposed solution is the creation of a **European AI Oversight Board** for border security, which would ensure that predictive algorithms do not use biased data that targets specific ethnic or religious groups.[^34]

Furthermore, technological solutions must address the **False Positive problem**: if AI mistakenly identifies a group of fishermen as a smuggling vessel, it could lead to dangerous maritime confrontations.[^12] Delegates might consider proposing a framework that mandates **human-in-the-loop decision-making**, where AI provides the data, but a human officer must verify every enforcement action to ensure it complies with international maritime law.[^17]

### Separating Security from Asylum

Many analysts argue that the logistical crisis at the border exists because there are almost no legal ways for individuals to enter the EU to work or seek safety. This forces everyone, including economic migrants and refugees, into the same irregular channel, which overwhelms the asylum system.

A potential legal solution is the massive expansion of **Talent Partnerships** and **humanitarian visas**.[^20] By creating a legal, administrative route for individuals to apply for work permits from their home countries, the EU could theoretically drain the irregular routes, leaving the border infrastructure free to focus exclusively on those with genuine protection needs.

This solution requires a fundamental shift in how EU nations view their labor markets. Instead of viewing migration purely as a security threat, nations would need to view it as a solution to Europe's shrinking and aging workforce.

Some proposals suggest a **Single Window application system**, where a person in Egypt or Senegal could apply for a job in Germany through an EU-run portal.[^31] If they are hired, they would receive a digital visa and fly directly to their destination, bypassing smugglers and Mediterranean crossings entirely.

While this would drastically reduce pressure on frontline states, it remains politically sensitive: many European voters are wary of increasing any form of migration, even when it is legal and organized.[^11]

### Flexible Responsibility Strategies

To resolve the internal friction between member states, a more radical legal solution involves replacing the first country of entry rule with a **Permanent Solidarity Mechanism**.

Unlike the current system, which relies on temporary agreements, this model would treat the EU's external border as a truly shared asset. In this scenario, when an individual arrives in Italy, they are not Italy's responsibility, but the EU's responsibility.[^28] Their asylum claim would be processed by an EU-wide agency (the EUAA), and if granted, they would be distributed across the 27 member states based on a formula that accounts for each nation's GDP, population size, and unemployment rate.

To make this acceptable to reluctant nations, a flexible version of this solution has been proposed. Nations that do not want to host refugees could instead fulfill their solidarity obligation by paying for the Return Hubs or by providing the high-tech equipment (drones, sensors, and personnel) needed to secure the perimeter.[^24]

This model recognizes that while every nation must contribute to the collective security, not every nation is equally capable of integrating new residents. The challenge for delegates is to find the right balance—a contribution formula high enough to be effective, yet not so demanding that it causes a member state to leave the Union in protest.[^12]

### Circular Migration

A final, long-term solution focuses on addressing the factors that drive people to the EU borders in the first place. Instead of spending billions on fences, the EU could invest in **Regional Development Compacts** with African and Middle Eastern nations. These compacts would go beyond simple aid: they would involve building schools, hospitals, and green energy projects that create local jobs, making the dangerous journey to Europe less attractive.[^7]

A key part of this strategy is **Circular Migration**, where individuals are allowed to come to Europe for a few years to gain skills and save money, with a guaranteed legal path to return home and start their own businesses.[^7] This prevents the brain drain from developing nations while providing the EU with temporary labor.

By turning the border from a wall into a revolving door, the EU could create a more sustainable and humane system. But the success of this solution depends on the stability of partner governments. If a partner nation experiences a civil war or a coup, the entire development compact could collapse, leaving the EU with neither a secure border nor a stable neighbor.[^4]

## Potential Blocs

The issue of border security and refugee management creates deep divisions within the European Union, splitting the 27 member states into distinct groups based on their geography and national priorities. A nation's position is largely determined by its proximity to external borders, its status as a preferred destination, or its fiscal priorities. Reaching consensus requires balancing the urgent security needs of frontier nations with the social and financial concerns of interior states.[^2]

### The Frontline Sovereigntists

Located at the Union's external perimeter, particularly along the Mediterranean and eastern land borders, these nations view the crisis as a daily logistical reality. They prioritize **border hardening**: the physical and technological strengthening of the perimeter.[^13]

Their goal is to secure massive EU funding for fences, patrol boats, and high-tech surveillance. Feeling like buffer zones for the rest of Europe, they are the strongest advocates for **externalization**—shifting migration management to third-party countries like Libya or Turkey.[^16] In exchange for securing the perimeter, they demand an automatic, mandatory relocation of arrivals to other EU states, viewing a refusal to share this burden as a failure of European solidarity.[^5]

### The Interior Destination States

These wealthy, northern, or landlocked nations are the primary targets for secondary movements: people who enter at the border but travel internally to reach the north.[^26] They prioritize **registration and return**, arguing that frontline states often fail to properly track arrivals.

Their ideal solution is strict enforcement of the first country of entry rule, ensuring individuals remain where they first arrive until their claims are processed.[^17] Skeptical of mandatory quotas, they prefer creating Return Hubs to speed up the deportation of those without protection status, aiming to protect national social systems from being overwhelmed.[^18]

### The Fiscal and Legal Minimalists

This group focuses on the financial and legal costs of Union-wide policies. Wary of transferring sovereign powers to a central EU agency, they prefer a **Flexible Solidarity model** where nations choose their contributions.[^9]

If a state declines to host refugees, they argue it should contribute in-kind by providing border guards or funding surveillance technology.[^17] They advocate for technical fixes over human-centric ones, believing the Integrated Border Management Fund (IBMF) can solve the crisis through digital gates rather than political quotas. They are cautious about expanding legal migration paths, fearing such changes are irreversible.[^19]

### The Humanitarian Advocates

A smaller group prioritizing the values of the Union, these states argue that border security is meaningless if it violates human dignity.[^13] They are the primary skeptics of externalization deals, believing the EU cannot outsource its moral obligations to third countries with poor human rights records.

Their ideal solutions involve **Humanitarian Corridors** and safe, legal visas for those in conflict zones.[^14] They advocate for strict oversight of Frontex to prevent pushbacks, asserting that the EU must remain a safe haven for the vulnerable while maintaining its security.[^25]
