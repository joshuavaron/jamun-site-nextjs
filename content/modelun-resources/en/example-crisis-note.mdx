Crisis notes are how you take private actions in crisis committees. This example demonstrates effective techniques for writing crisis notes that advance your backroom goals.

## Example Crisis Note

**Committee:** Manhattan Project Crisis

**Character:** J. Robert Oppenheimer

### Note Text

> Dear Emily Roberts,
>
> My wonderful assistant! You have worked with me for over a decade, and I am still overjoyed every time I get the opportunity to send you a letter. Your service has been characterized by complete loyalty, discretion, and commitment; I appreciate everything that you have done for me very much.
>
> As I'm sure you know, I cannot disclose specific details of my recent work. That said, I have a task that I must ask you to do.
>
> I can still remember the vacation my family and I took to Geneva, Switzerland. I yearn for the tranquil parks, lakes, and roads that appeared throughout the city. I would quite like to surprise my family with a vacation house there.
>
> Over the next weeks, I will begin sending you money that I have earned in my recent work, as well as money that I have saved from my years spent in academia. Please begin collecting this money, as well as researching real estate in Geneva. If you find any promising properties, please let me know so I can consider whether it would be a wise investment.
>
> Yours very truly,
> J. Robert Oppenheimer

## What Makes This Crisis Note Effective

### Establishing a Relationship

**(a)** The note opens by clearly establishing a long-term relationship with a loyal, fictional assistant.

**(b)** The phrase "You have worked with me for over a decade" creates a trusted contact who can carry out sensitive tasks.

**(c)** Emphasizing loyalty and discretion establishes that this person can be trusted with private matters.

### Staying in Character

**(a)** The note stays entirely in character as a personal letter.

**(b)** There are no out-of-character comments, parenthetical notes, or explanations to the crisis staff.

**(c)** The delegate writes as if actually sending this letter, using appropriate tone and language.

**(d)** The formal closing ("Yours very truly") matches the time period and character.

### Giving Specific Instructions

The note provides clear, actionable instructions:

**(a)** Collect money being sent

**(b)** Research real estate in Geneva

**(c)** Report back on promising properties

### Hiding True Intentions

**(a)** The true intention (potentially preparing to flee the country) is never explicitly stated.

**(b)** The cover story (a vacation home surprise for family) is plausible and innocent.

**(c)** The delegate lets their actions speak rather than explaining their real goals.

**(d)** This approach maintains plausible deniability while advancing the backroom arc.

### Introducing Character Assets

The note subtly introduces valuable character assets:

**(a)** **A trusted assistant**: A loyal contact with a decade of service

**(b)** **Financial resources**: Funds from government work and academia

**(c)** **Family**: Potential motivation and vulnerability

**(d)** **Past experiences**: The Geneva vacation establishes familiarity with a neutral country

## Key Techniques for Crisis Notes

### Do

**(1)** **Create relationships** with fictional or real figures who can help you.

**(2)** **Stay in character** at all times—write as your character, not as a delegate.

**(3)** **Be specific** about what you want to accomplish.

**(4)** **Build gradually** toward larger goals.

**(5)** **Show, don't tell**—let your actions reveal your intentions.

**(6)** **Establish assets** that you can use later (money, allies, information).

**(7)** **Use appropriate tone** for the time period and your character's background.

### Don't

**(1)** **Don't break character** with parenthetical explanations to staff.

**(2)** **Don't state your true intentions explicitly** if they should be secret.

**(3)** **Don't try to do too much** in a single note—build incrementally.

**(4)** **Don't assume success**—wait for staff responses before building on actions.

**(5)** **Don't ignore your portfolio powers**—use what your character actually has access to.

## Types of Crisis Notes

### Relationship-Building Notes

**(a)** Establish connections with people who can help you.

**(b)** Reference shared history or create plausible relationships.

**(c)** Build trust before asking for significant favors.

### Resource-Gathering Notes

**(a)** Accumulate assets: money, information, weapons, allies.

**(b)** These resources form the foundation for bigger moves later.

**(c)** Be patient—building resources takes time.

### Action Notes

**(a)** Take specific actions using your established resources.

**(b)** Be clear about what you want to happen.

**(c)** Consider potential consequences and prepare contingencies.

### Information-Gathering Notes

**(a)** Request intelligence about other characters, events, or situations.

**(b)** Use your contacts to learn things that aren't publicly known.

**(c)** Information can be as valuable as physical resources.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should a crisis note be?

**(a)** Quality matters more than quantity.

**(b)** A clear, specific note of a few sentences can be more effective than a rambling page.

### How do I know if my note succeeded?

**(a)** Crisis staff will respond to your notes, usually within one or two crisis cycles.

**(b)** Their response will indicate success, failure, or unexpected consequences.

**(c)** If you don't hear back, politely ask staff if they received your note.

### Can I create fictional contacts?

**(a)** Yes! Fictional characters are allowed and often encouraged.

**(b)** Make the relationship believable given your character's background.
