Directives are the crisis committee equivalent of resolutions. They're shorter, faster, and more action-oriented than GA resolutions. This outline will help you write effective directives.

## What Is a Directive?

**(a)** Directives are formal documents passed by crisis committees to take collective action.

**(b)** Unlike GA resolutions, directives actually make things happen in the simulation.

**(c)** Directives focus on operative clauses—there are no preambulatory clauses.

**(d)** They're typically shorter and more direct than GA resolutions.

## Header Information

Every directive begins with a header containing essential information:

### Title

**(a)** Create a creative or descriptive title for your directive.

**(b)** Acronyms are popular in crisis committees.

**(c)** Example: *DUSTIN (Developing Unforgettable Simulations for Thoughtful International Negotiations)*

### Committee Name

**(a)** Include the name of your committee.

**(b)** Example: *JAMUN Secretariat* or *Cabinet of King Henry VIII*

### Sponsors

**(a)** List the main authors of the directive.

**(b)** Sponsor limits vary by committee—check with your chairs.

**(c)** Example: *Dustin, Joshua, Emma*

### Signatories

**(a)** List delegates who want the directive brought to the floor for debate.

**(b)** Signatory requirements vary by committee.

**(c)** Example: *Sahana, Sam, Miranda, Abby*

## Operative Clauses

Directives consist entirely of operative clauses—the actions the committee is taking.

### Format

**(a)** Each clause begins with a **bolded** verb in the simple present tense.

**(b)** Clauses are **numbered** (1, 2, 3...).

**(c)** Sub-clauses use letters (a, b, c) and then roman numerals (i, ii, iii).

**(d)** Each clause ends with a **period** (not a semicolon like GA resolutions).

### Common Operative Verbs

| Verb | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Creates** | Establishing new organizations, programs, or structures |
| **Directs** | Ordering specific actions to be taken |
| **Establishes** | Setting up new institutions or mechanisms |
| **Moves** | Relocating resources, troops, or personnel |
| **Calls upon** | Requesting action from others |
| **Authorizes** | Granting permission or power |
| **Deploys** | Sending forces or resources |
| **Allocates** | Assigning funds or resources |
| **Appoints** | Naming individuals to positions |
| **Orders** | Commanding specific actions (strong) |

### Example Operative Clauses

> **1. Creates** a new intelligence agency to gather information on enemy movements.
>
> **(a)** This agency will report directly to the committee.
>
> **(b)** The agency is authorized to:
>
> **(i)** Recruit agents in foreign territories;
>
> **(ii)** Establish safe houses in major cities.
>
> **2. Directs** the treasury to allocate 500,000 gold pieces to the war effort.

## Quick Reference

| Element | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Title | Creative name or acronym | DUSTIN |
| Committee | Committee name | JAMUN Secretariat |
| Sponsors | Main authors | Dustin, Joshua, Emma |
| Signatories | Want it debated | Sahana, Sam, Miranda |
| Operative Clauses | **Bolded** verb, numbered, ends with period | **1. Creates**... |

## Differences from GA Resolutions

| Feature | GA Resolution | Crisis Directive |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Preambulatory clauses | Yes | No |
| Clause ending | Semicolon (period for last) | Period |
| Length | Longer, more detailed | Shorter, more direct |
| Effect | Recommends action | Actually makes things happen |
| Verb tense | Third person present (Calls upon) | Simple present (Create, Direct) |
| Tone | Diplomatic | Action-oriented |

## Tips for Effective Directives

**(1)** **Be specific**: Include concrete details about what should happen, who is responsible, and what resources are involved.

**(2)** **Be action-oriented**: Directives should do things, not just express opinions.

**(3)** **Consider consequences**: Think about how your actions might affect the crisis's development.

**(4)** **Be realistic**: Propose actions within the committee's actual power and resources.

**(5)** **Address the current crisis**: Focus on the immediate situation, not long-term planning.

**(6)** **Coordinate with allies**: Work with your coalition to ensure directive support.
