Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to the Chinese Civil War at JAMUN! This crisis committee promises to be an intense and challenging experience as you immerse yourself in one of the 20th century's most consequential conflicts.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,

Joshua Varon

Founder, JAMUN
