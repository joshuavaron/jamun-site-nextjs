## Letter from the Chair

Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to SOCHUM at JAMUN! This committee promises to be an engaging and rewarding experience as we address the pressing humanitarian issues of homelessness and refugee displacement in Europe.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,

Joshua Varon

Founder, JAMUN

## Structure and Mechanics

The Anya-Nya Rebellion: The United Southern Front, 1965 is a continuous crisis committee. You may not have experience with this format, so this section lays out the general structure and flow of the committee to help all delegates participate effectively.

As mentioned, this committee uses the crisis format for all sessions. Crisis committees can be divided into two distinct parts: the **front room** and the **back room**. In the front room, you'll engage in directive writing and respond to crisis breaks. In the back room, you'll write notes to advance your personal goals.

Here's how the cycle works:

**(a)** A crisis break introduces new problems for the committee to address

**(b)** Delegates debate and work together to draft directives

**(c)** The committee votes on directives

**(d)** The Crisis Directors prepare a new crisis break based on your actions, and the cycle repeats

In practice, this means that when we begin the first session, you'll be introduced to a crisis break highlighting the committee's initial problems—such as intensifying military pressure from Khartoum and internal fractures within the Southern leadership. Early crises will focus on issues covered in this background guide. As the conference progresses, crisis breaks will increasingly be driven by delegate actions in the back room through your crisis notes.

Delegates work together to solve these crises through **directives**. Think of directives as targeted solutions for different aspects of the crisis being presented—organizing a guerrilla ambush in the Equatoria bush or negotiating with regional neighbors for arms, for example. To pass directives, you'll need to give speeches, debate during moderated caucuses, and collaborate in blocs during unmoderated caucuses. The backroom staff monitors all directives as they're presented and designs crisis breaks that respond to the ones you pass.

### Your Personal Goals

Come prepared with an idea for your character's goal for the committee. These goals should ideally be achievable within five committee sessions and don't have to align with the overall committee's objectives. You'll use crisis notes to advance these goals—we strongly encourage you to include your goals in your first crisis note.

Notes should be written in character and directed to someone like a local tribal leader, a sympathetic foreign intelligence officer, or a field commander. Include clear instructions for specific tasks that will help you achieve your goal. The clearer the connection to your end goal, the easier it will be for the Assistant Chairs to help you succeed.

### Building Your Resources

In the beginning, focus on accumulating resources and laying the foundation for your goals. A good rule of thumb: build up your finances, local tribal support, hidden supply caches, and manpower before executing major actions.

When requesting resources, consider the historical context and your character's background. Since this committee takes place in 1965, we won't grant modern technology like GPS or cellular communications—that wouldn't be realistic for the time period.

Your goal with notes should be to trigger crisis breaks in the front room as often as possible. Make your actions sufficiently disruptive or impactful to warrant a crisis response.

We're excited to see how you navigate these mechanisms and use all the resources at your disposal. Think creatively about how you approach the problems you'll face. Before the conference, we encourage you to visit the MUNUC website to familiarize yourself with typical terminology and best practices. If anything is unclear, don't hesitate to reach out.

## History of the Problem

### Pre-Colonial Origins

The division between Northern and Southern Sudan isn't a modern invention—it's the product of centuries of diverging cultural, religious, and economic development. In the North, the Nile served as a highway for the spread of Islam and the Arabic language, particularly after the collapse of the Christian Nubian kingdoms. This region became deeply integrated into Middle Eastern trade networks, fostering an identity tied to the Arab-Islamic world.[^17]

The South tells a different story. Comprising the vast swamplands of the Sudd and the tropical forests of Equatoria, the region remained geographically isolated. The Nilotic peoples—the Dinka, Nuer, and Shilluk—along with the Azande and other groups, maintained decentralized societies rooted in pastoralism and indigenous spiritual traditions. Their first major contact with the North often came through exploitation during the Turkiyya, the period of Ottoman-Egyptian rule beginning in 1821.[^30]

During this era, Northern Arab merchants and Egyptian administrators moved South primarily to exploit the region for ivory and, most destructively, slaves. The Turko-Egyptian period left a lasting legacy of trauma and mistrust. To Southerners, Northerners became the *Mundukuru* or *Jallaba*—terms synonymous with foreign oppressors and slave traders. This historical memory remains a primary driver of the current resistance.[^20]

### The Anglo-Egyptian Condominium

Following the British defeat of the Mahdist forces in 1898, the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium was established. British administrators quickly recognized the fundamental differences between the two regions and decided to govern them separately. In the North, the British invested in the Gezira Scheme for cotton production, built railroads, and established Gordon Memorial College to train a local civil service.[^19]

The South received very different treatment. In 1930, the British implemented the **Southern Policy**, creating a Closed Districts system designed to protect the South from Northern influence. Northerners needed passports to travel South. Arabic names and dress were discouraged. Islam was barred from the region. Instead, Christian missionary groups managed education and healthcare, teaching in English and local languages.

The Southern Policy successfully preserved African cultural identities—but it also ensured that the South remained economically and politically stagnant. By the end of World War II, the North had a modern bureaucracy and a growing nationalist movement, while the South was a collection of isolated tribal districts with almost no administrative capacity or infrastructure beyond basic missionary outposts.[^38]

### The 1947 Juba Conference

As global decolonization accelerated, the British faced pressure from Northern nationalists to unite the country. In a sudden and controversial reversal of thirty years of policy, they convened the **Juba Conference** in 1947.[^4] For the first time, Southern tribal chiefs and a handful of educated Southerners were brought together to discuss the future of a unified Sudan.

The Southern delegates expressed profound anxiety about being absorbed by the more advanced North. They requested a federal system that would allow the South to maintain its own laws, languages, and religious freedoms.[^3] British officials, eager to exit the region and appease Northern political parties like the Umma, assured the Southerners that their rights would be protected in a unitary state.

The conference failed to produce any legally binding guarantees. The Southerners felt manipulated and betrayed, realizing that the British were handing them over to a Northern government with no interest in their welfare. This failure to secure a federalist constitutional arrangement remains the original sin of Sudanese independence and the primary grievance cited by the United Southern Front today.[^21]

### Sudanization

The years leading up to independence in 1956 saw the rapid **Sudanization** of the government—replacing departing British colonial officers with local Sudanese. When the results were announced in 1954, the South was horrified to discover that out of 800 senior government positions, only six were awarded to Southerners. The rest went to Northerners, many of whom behaved like new colonial masters.[^12]

Tensions reached a breaking point in August 1955. In the town of Torit, the Equatoria Corps of the Sudan Defence Force—a unit composed entirely of Southerners—received orders to transfer to the North. Fearing they were being led into a trap to be disarmed or executed, the troops mutinied. They killed several of their Northern officers and took control of the town, sparking a wave of anti-Northern violence across the province.

The British eventually persuaded the mutineers to surrender by promising a fair trial and continued negotiations. Once the Northern government took control, they executed many participants and began a harsh crackdown. Hundreds of soldiers fled into the bush or across the border into Uganda, taking their weapons with them.[^13] These fugitives became the **Forest Boys**—the first organized guerrillas of the movement that would become the Anya-Nya.

### Independence and the Rise of Arabization

Sudan officially became independent on January 1, 1956. For the South, the celebrations were short-lived. The transitional government in Khartoum, led by Ismail al-Azhari, almost immediately began imposing a single national identity on the diverse country. This process—known as **Arabization and Islamization**—was seen as a tool of Northern control.[^1]

The government nationalized all missionary schools in the South, replacing the English curriculum with Arabic and forcing Christian students to study Islam. In 1962, the Missionary Societies Act effectively allowed the government to expel foreign priests and shut down churches. These weren't just religious actions—they were attempts to erase the Southern identity that had developed under British rule.[^11]

Economic neglect of the South continued unabated. The North received international aid and industrial development; the South remained impoverished. The few Southern politicians in Khartoum found themselves sidelined and ignored, unable to pass even simple legislation for their constituents. By the late 1950s, many had concluded that armed struggle was the only way to save the South.[^2]

### The Military Regime of Ibrahim Abboud

In 1958, General Ibrahim Abboud seized power in a military coup. Abboud believed the "Southern Problem" was merely a matter of law and order that could be solved through overwhelming force. He intensified military operations in the southern provinces, burning villages and using scorched-earth tactics to deny the rebels food and shelter.[^30]

Instead of crushing the rebellion, Abboud's brutality became a recruitment tool. Thousands of young men joined the Anya-Nya, which by 1963 had become a formidable guerrilla force under leaders like veteran soldier Joseph Lagu. The war also created a massive refugee crisis, with over 100,000 Southerners fleeing to neighboring countries, where they began organizing a political wing to support the fighters.[^31]

The failure of Abboud's military strategy eventually led to his downfall. The cost of the war drained the national treasury and sparked protests in Khartoum. In October 1964, a popular uprising known as the **October Revolution** forced Abboud to resign, briefly raising hopes that a civilian government might finally address Southern demands for peace and federalism.[^18]

### The Round Table Conference

The new civilian government, under Prime Minister Sirr al-Khatim al-Khalifa, initially showed willingness to negotiate. They convened the **Round Table Conference** in March 1965, inviting both Northern political parties and Southern leaders, including the newly formed Southern Front.[^17] The conference quickly deadlocked. Northern parties refused to discuss anything beyond local administrative autonomy, while Southern delegates demanded a referendum on self-determination.

Politicians talked in Khartoum. On the ground, the situation became a nightmare. In July 1965, the Sudanese army carried out horrific massacres in Juba and Wau, killing hundreds of educated Southerners—including government officials and students. These events, often called the **Juba Massacre**, convinced Southern leadership that the Northern government was committed to a genocidal solution.[^20]

As we begin this committee, the United Southern Front has been formed to unify the various political and military factions. Trust in a peaceful, united Sudan has been shattered by the blood spilled in Juba's streets. The delegates now carry the weight of a people who believe their very survival depends on the success of the Anya-Nya rebellion.[^10]

## Statement of the Problem

### The Shadow of the Massacres

The crisis today is driven by a deep sense of fear that has spread through every Southern village and town. In July 1965, the violence in Juba and Wau changed everything. When Northern soldiers began attacking educated Southerners in their own homes, they weren't just fighting rebels—they were attacking the future of the South. Teachers, doctors, and students—the very people needed to build a new country—were specifically targeted. This has left a gaping hole in the heart of the community.[^11]

This fear has transformed into powerful and dangerous energy. The public is no longer interested in slow negotiations or complicated political deals. They want safety, and they want it now. For the delegates in this committee, this means you're working under a tight clock. If you spend too much time debating small details, the people back home might lose faith in your leadership. They're looking for heroes who can protect them from the next attack, not politicians who talk in comfortable rooms.[^14]

The massacres have made peace almost impossible to imagine. Every time a Northern politician offers a new deal, Southerners remember the blood in Juba's streets. Your job is to figure out if there's any way to build a future when the past is so full of pain.

### The Deepening Divide Between Leaders

The enemy is clear. The path to victory is not. A serious split exists between two main schools of thought in this committee.

The **moderates** believe that the South is too poor and too weak to stand alone right now. They want a federal system where the South remains part of Sudan but has its own army and schools. They think this is the only way to get the North to stop fighting and start helping.[^24]

The **separatists** think the moderates are being naive. They point to the many broken promises since 1947 as proof that Khartoum will never share power. They believe that as long as the South is tied to the North, it will always be treated like a colony. This group wants total independence—a brand new country with its own flag and its own seat at the United Nations.

This isn't just a small disagreement—it affects every decision you make. Should you send a letter to the Prime Minister or blow up his supply trains? Should you ask for a better seat in the Sudanese parliament or start printing your own money? If the delegates can't find a way to balance these goals, the United Southern Front will fall apart from the inside before the war really begins.[^31]

### A War of Spears Against Tanks

Military reality is the most urgent problem on your plate. The Northern army is a professional force with modern equipment—heavy machine guns, armored cars, and planes that can see everything from the sky. They're organized, well-fed, and paid on time. They're currently pushing deep into Southern territory, setting up forts in all major towns and trying to cut the South into pieces.[^34]

The Anya-Nya fighters face a much tougher situation. They're mostly hiding in the bush with few supplies and almost no way to communicate across long distances. Their weapons are a mix of old British rifles from the 1940s and traditional spears or bows, which means they often run out of ammunition after just a few minutes of heavy fighting. The rebellion cannot survive a direct confrontation.

Delegates must be extremely creative to win. You can't win a face-to-face fight, so you must use the land to your advantage. Turn the swamps and forests into a trap for Northern soldiers. But even the best tactics won't work without bullets.[^25] A major part of your job will be finding ways to get modern guns into your fighters' hands without getting caught. Without a real military plan, the USF is just a group of people hiding in the woods.

### The Human Cost

The war has created a massive wave of human suffering that can't be ignored. Over 100,000 people have been forced to leave their homes and everything they own. They're living in makeshift camps in the forest or in crowded refugee centers across the border in countries like Uganda. In these places, there's almost no food, no clean water, and no doctors. Children are dying from simple diseases that could be cured with basic medicine if only it were available.[^29]

The Northern army is also intentionally making things worse through **scorched-earth tactics**. They burn crops and kill cattle in any village they suspect might be helping the rebels. They want to make the South so hungry that the people give up.[^16] This puts enormous weight on delegates—you're not just commanding soldiers; you're responsible for feeding a nation.

If people start to starve, they'll stop supporting the rebellion. They might even turn in Anya-Nya fighters just to get a bowl of grain from the government. You must find ways to protect the farms and get humanitarian aid to those who need it most. A rebellion that can't feed its people is a rebellion doomed to fail.[^9]

### Breaking the Silence

Right now, the rest of the world knows almost nothing about what's happening in Southern Sudan. The government in Khartoum tells everyone that the war is just a small police action against a few bandits. Because there are no international reporters in the bush, the truth about the massacres and burning villages isn't getting out. The South is fighting and dying in total silence.[^7]

To change this, delegates need to become world-class diplomats. You need to convince other countries that the South is a real nation that deserves to be free. This is difficult—many neighbors like Ethiopia and Kenya fear that if the South breaks away, it will encourage separatist groups in their own countries. They're nervous about supporting you openly.

You also have to navigate the Cold War. If you can convince the United States or the Soviet Union that helping you serves their interests, you might get the money and weapons you need. Be careful, though: if you become a puppet for a major power, you might lose the very freedom you're fighting for. Your challenge is to make the world care about the South before it's too late.[^7]
