General Assembly (GA) committees are the heart of the Model UN experience. These large committees simulate how the real United Nations General Assembly operates—through formal debate, coalition building, and collaborative resolution writing. This guide walks you through the typical flow of a GA committee from start to finish.

## Overview of GA Committees

General Assembly committees share several key characteristics:

**(a)** **Large size**: Typically 50-150 delegates representing different countries.

**(b)** **Formal procedure**: Debate follows parliamentary rules with speakers' lists, moderated caucuses, and unmoderated caucuses.

**(c)** **Resolution-focused**: The goal is to produce and pass resolutions that address the committee's topic.

**(d)** **Coalition-driven**: Success requires building alliances and working with other delegates.

**(e)** **Measured pace**: Unlike crisis committees, GA committees move deliberately, giving you time to research, negotiate, and refine your positions.

## Phase 1: Opening Debate

The committee begins with opening debate, where delegates establish their countries' positions and identify potential allies.

### Setting the Agenda (If Applicable)

**(a)** If your committee has multiple topics, you'll first vote on which topic to discuss.

**(b)** Use opening speeches to advocate for your preferred topic order.

**(c)** The topic receiving majority support becomes the focus of debate.

### Opening Speeches

During the initial speakers' list and moderated caucuses:

**(a)** **Establish your position**: Clearly state what your country believes about the topic. For example: "The Kingdom of Denmark believes that UN member states should prioritize renewable energy investments..."

**(b)** **Signal your approach**: Indicate what solutions your country supports and what it opposes.

**(c)** **Invite collaboration**: Mention specific countries or groups you want to work with: "Denmark looks forward to collaborating with our European partners and other like-minded nations..."

**(d)** **Listen actively**: Take notes on other delegates' speeches to identify potential allies and understand opposing viewpoints.

### Identifying Allies

During opening debate, start identifying countries that share your positions:

**(a)** **Regional partners**: Countries from your geographic region often share similar interests.

**(b)** **Ideological allies**: Countries with similar political systems or values may align on many issues.

**(c)** **Issue-specific partners**: On specific topics, unexpected allies may emerge based on shared concerns.

**(d)** **Pass notes**: During moderated caucuses, send notes to potential allies suggesting collaboration.

## Phase 2: Bloc Formation

As debate progresses, delegates begin forming coalitions (blocs) to work together on solutions.

### Building Your Bloc

**(a)** **Start early**: Don't wait—approach like-minded delegates during the first unmoderated caucuses.

**(b)** **Be inclusive**: Larger blocs have better chances of passing resolutions. Welcome delegates who share your general approach.

**(c)** **Establish leadership**: Every bloc needs someone to coordinate efforts, but leadership should be collaborative, not dictatorial.

**(d)** **Give your bloc a name**: A memorable name helps with identity and communication. Examples: "The Western Bloc," "The Coalition for Sustainable Development," "The G20+ Alliance."

### Recruiting Members

During unmoderated caucuses:

**(a)** **Approach uncommitted delegates**: Look for delegates who haven't joined a bloc yet and invite them to work with you.

**(b)** **Explain your approach**: Briefly describe your bloc's main ideas and how they align with the potential member's interests.

**(c)** **Be flexible**: Be willing to incorporate others' ideas to gain their support.

**(d)** **Maintain relationships**: Even if a delegate joins a different bloc, keep communication open for potential future collaboration.

### Bloc Dynamics

**(a)** **Divide responsibilities**: Assign different members to draft different sections of your working paper.

**(b)** **Hold bloc meetings**: Use unmoderated caucuses for internal discussions and progress checks.

**(c)** **Resolve disagreements**: When bloc members disagree, find compromise language that incorporates multiple perspectives.

**(d)** **Stay united in speeches**: When speaking in moderated caucuses, reference your bloc's ideas and support your bloc members' points.

## Phase 3: Working Papers

Working papers are informal documents where blocs develop their proposed solutions.

### Writing Your Working Paper

**(a)** **Start early**: Begin drafting during Phase 2, even if your ideas aren't fully formed.

**(b)** **Be detailed**: Include specific proposals, not vague statements. "Establish a $500 million fund for climate adaptation" is better than "increase funding."

**(c)** **Organize logically**: Group related ideas together and build from foundational concepts to specific proposals.

**(d)** **Consider implementation**: Think about how your proposals would work in practice—who does what, when, and how is it funded?

### Working Paper Structure

While working papers are informal, a clear structure helps:

**(a)** **Introduction**: Briefly state the problem and your bloc's overall approach.

**(b)** **Main proposals**: Your key solutions, organized by theme or priority.

**(c)** **Implementation details**: How your proposals would be carried out.

**(d)** **Funding mechanisms**: How your proposals would be financed.

### Promoting Your Working Paper

**(a)** **Reference it in speeches**: During moderated caucuses, mention your bloc's ideas: "The Western Bloc believes that our approach to renewable energy financing, as outlined in our working paper, offers a practical path forward..."

**(b)** **Gather feedback**: Share your working paper with delegates outside your bloc and incorporate useful suggestions.

**(c)** **Build interest**: Generate support for your ideas so that when merger discussions begin, your working paper is seen as valuable.

## Phase 4: Mergers

Chairs typically limit the number of draft resolutions that can be voted on. This means blocs must merge their working papers into combined draft resolutions.

### Why Mergers Happen

**(a)** **Limited slots**: Chairs want to avoid voting on many similar resolutions.

**(b)** **Stronger coalitions**: Merged blocs have more votes behind their resolution.

**(c)** **Better solutions**: Combining ideas from multiple working papers often produces more comprehensive resolutions.

### Merger Strategy

**(a)** **Identify compatible blocs**: Look for blocs with similar approaches to yours. Merging is easier when you start from common ground.

**(b)** **Approach early**: Don't wait until the last minute. Begin merger discussions as soon as chairs indicate they're needed.

**(c)** **Know your priorities**: Before negotiating, identify which of your ideas are essential and which are negotiable.

### The Merger Process

**(1)** **Initial discussions**: Representatives from each bloc meet to discuss overall compatibility.

**(2)** **Identify overlap**: Find areas where your working papers already agree.

**(3)** **Resolve differences**: Negotiate on areas where you disagree. Find compromise language or decide whose approach to use.

**(4)** **Combine strengths**: Take the best elements from each working paper.

**(5)** **Write together**: Draft the merged resolution collaboratively, ensuring all bloc members contribute.

**(6)** **Finalize sponsorship**: Determine how sponsors and signatories will be distributed across the merged group.

### Naming Your Resolution

**(a)** Draft resolutions with memorable names stand out during voting.

**(b)** Acronyms are popular: "Better Regulations Eliminating Airborne Toxic Health Effects (BREATHE)" for an air pollution resolution.

**(c)** Keep it relevant and professional—clever is good, but don't sacrifice clarity for creativity.

## Phase 5: Draft Resolutions

Once mergers are complete, working papers become formal draft resolutions.

### Formalizing Your Resolution

To introduce a draft resolution, you need:

**(a)** **Sponsors**: The main authors (maximum 5% of committee, rounded up). All sponsors must agree to the resolution's content.

**(b)** **Signatories**: Delegates who want to see it debated (minimum 20% of committee, rounded down). Signatories don't have to support the resolution—they just want it discussed.

### Resolution Format

Transform your working paper into proper resolution format:

**(a)** **Header**: Committee name, topic, sponsors, signatories, and resolution title.

**(b)** **Preambulatory clauses**: Context and background. Each begins with an italicized phrase (*Recognizing*, *Noting with concern*, etc.) and ends with a comma.

**(c)** **Operative clauses**: Your proposals. Each begins with a bolded phrase (**Calls upon**, **Recommends**, etc.), is numbered, and ends with a semicolon (period for the last clause).

### Gathering Signatories

**(a)** **Cast a wide net**: Approach delegates from outside your bloc. Remember, signatories just want the resolution debated—they can still vote against it.

**(b)** **Explain your resolution**: Briefly describe your main proposals and why they matter.

**(c)** **Use unmoderated time**: This is when most signatory gathering happens.

**(d)** **Track your progress**: Keep a list of who has signed so you know when you've reached the minimum.

## Phase 6: Debate on Draft Resolutions

Once draft resolutions are introduced, the committee debates them before voting.

### Presenting Your Resolution

**(a)** **Introduce clearly**: Explain the problem your resolution addresses and your main approach.

**(b)** **Highlight key clauses**: You can't explain everything—focus on your most important proposals.

**(c)** **Explain the benefits**: Why is your approach effective? What makes it better than alternatives?

**(d)** **Invite questions**: Show confidence by welcoming scrutiny.

### Question and Answer Period

After presentation, delegates can ask questions about the resolution:

**(a)** **Know your resolution thoroughly**: Be prepared to explain any clause in detail.

**(b)** **Answer directly**: Don't dodge questions. If you don't know something, say so honestly.

**(c)** **Defend diplomatically**: When facing criticism, respond calmly and substantively.

**(d)** **Coordinate with co-sponsors**: Decide in advance who will answer questions on which topics.

### For and Against Debate

Some committees hold structured debate where delegates speak for and against each resolution:

**(a)** **Speaking for**: Highlight the resolution's strengths and why it deserves support.

**(b)** **Speaking against**: Identify weaknesses, gaps, or problems with the resolution. Be substantive, not personal.

**(c)** **Strategic speaking**: If you support a resolution, volunteer to speak for it. If you oppose it, volunteer to speak against.

### Amendments

Before voting, delegates can propose amendments:

**(a)** **Friendly amendments**: If all sponsors agree, the amendment is automatically incorporated.

**(b)** **Unfriendly amendments**: If sponsors don't agree, the amendment is voted on separately.

**(c)** **Strategic amendments**: Use amendments to strengthen resolutions you support or address concerns about resolutions you're considering.

## Phase 7: Voting

The committee votes on all draft resolutions that have been introduced.

### Entering Voting Procedure

**(a)** Once voting procedure begins, no one may enter or leave the room.

**(b)** All debate stops—no more speeches or discussion.

**(c)** Delegates should remain silent except when voting.

### Voting on Amendments

**(a)** Unfriendly amendments are voted on first.

**(b)** If an amendment passes, it becomes part of the resolution before the final vote.

**(c)** Amendments require a simple majority to pass.

### Voting on Resolutions

**(a)** **Procedural vote**: The Chair may first ask if there are any objections to passing the resolution by acclamation (unanimous consent). This is rare.

**(b)** **Substantive vote**: Delegates vote Yes, No, or Abstain (if they responded "Present" at roll call).

**(c)** **Simple majority**: A resolution passes if it receives more Yes votes than No votes (abstentions don't count).

**(d)** **Multiple resolutions**: More than one resolution can pass. If resolutions conflict, later-passed resolutions take precedence on conflicting points.

### Roll Call Votes

**(a)** Any delegate can request a roll call vote before voting begins.

**(b)** Each country is called individually and states their vote aloud.

**(c)** Delegates may vote "Yes," "No," "Abstain," or "Pass" (vote at the end).

## Timeline Overview

Here's how a typical GA committee progresses across sessions:

| Session | Primary Activities |
|---------|-------------------|
| Session 1 | Opening debate, topic selection (if applicable), initial position speeches |
| Session 2 | Continued debate, bloc formation begins, early working paper drafting |
| Session 3 | Working paper development, bloc consolidation, promotion of ideas |
| Session 4 | Merger discussions, working paper refinement |
| Session 5 | Finalize mergers, formalize draft resolutions, gather signatories |
| Session 6 | Present resolutions, Q&A, debate, amendments, voting |

This timeline is approximate—every committee moves at its own pace. Don't rush, but also don't fall behind.

## Tips for Success

### Throughout the Conference

**(a)** **Be consistent**: Participate actively in every session. Chairs notice delegates who stay engaged from start to finish.

**(b)** **Stay in character**: Always represent your country's actual positions, even if you personally disagree.

**(c)** **Be diplomatic**: Treat all delegates with respect, even those you disagree with.

**(d)** **Network constantly**: Use every unmoderated caucus to build relationships and advance your goals.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**(a)** **Waiting too long**: Don't wait until late sessions to join a bloc or start writing. Early action pays off.

**(b)** **Being too rigid**: Compromise is essential. Delegates who refuse to negotiate often find themselves isolated.

**(c)** **Neglecting relationships**: Focus on building genuine connections, not just transactional alliances.

**(d)** **Forgetting your country**: Everything you do should reflect your country's interests and positions.

### When Things Don't Go Your Way

**(a)** **Stay professional**: Even if your resolution fails or your bloc falls apart, maintain composure.

**(b)** **Adapt**: If your original plan isn't working, find a new approach.

**(c)** **Keep participating**: Contributing constructively to other resolutions still demonstrates valuable skills.

**(d)** **Learn from it**: Reflect on what happened and how you can improve next time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many blocs should there be?

This depends on committee size and topic complexity. Typically, 2-4 main blocs form, though some delegates may remain unaligned. Chairs will indicate how many draft resolutions they'll accept, which influences merger decisions.

### What if I disagree with my bloc?

Voice your concerns within the bloc first. If you can't reach agreement on something important, you may need to find a different bloc. However, try to resolve differences diplomatically before leaving—burning bridges isn't helpful.

### Can I be in multiple blocs?

Generally no—you should commit to one bloc for working paper and resolution development. However, you can maintain friendly relationships with other blocs and potentially support multiple resolutions during voting.

### What if my resolution doesn't pass?

It's disappointing, but not a failure. Chairs evaluate your performance throughout the conference, not just the final vote. Strong participation, good speeches, and collaborative behavior matter regardless of voting outcomes.
