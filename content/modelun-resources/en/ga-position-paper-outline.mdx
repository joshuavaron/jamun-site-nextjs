This outline provides a structured template for writing General Assembly position papers. Follow this format to create a compelling paper that demonstrates your preparation and clearly articulates your country's stance.

## Header

Include the following information at the top of your position paper:

**(a)** Your country name

**(b)** Committee name

**(c)** Topic title

**(d)** Your name and school (if required by the conference)

## Introduction

Start your position paper with a strong introduction that sets the stage for your country's stance. Your introduction should answer three key questions:

**(1)** Why is this topic important to the international community?

**(2)** How does this topic affect your nation specifically?

**(3)** What is your nation's official stance on this issue?

### Example Introduction

> "The Federal Republic of Germany recognizes climate change as one of the most pressing challenges facing the international community. As a leading industrial nation and strong advocate for sustainable development, Germany is deeply committed to reducing global carbon emissions and supporting developing nations in their transition to clean energy."

## Paragraph 1: Background and Past Actions

This paragraph establishes context and demonstrates your knowledge of existing efforts. It shows chairs that you understand what has already been done and why it matters.

### Structure

**(a)** **Topic Sentence**: How have past actions by the UN or other organizations addressed this topic?

**(b)** **Context**: Why are these past actions relevant to current discussions? What progress has been made?

**(c)** **Evidence**: Cite specific examples such as:

**(1)** Past UN resolutions (include resolution numbers if possible)

**(2)** International treaties and agreements

**(3)** Actions by regional organizations

**(4)** Previous committee decisions

**(d)** **Analysis**: Why does your evidence support your topic sentence? How do past efforts inform what should happen next?

**(e)** **Concluding Sentence**: Connect your evidence to your larger argument about what the committee should do.

### Example Paragraph

> "The Paris Agreement of 2015 marked a historic step forward in international climate cooperation, establishing the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Germany was among the first nations to ratify this agreement and has consistently exceeded its emissions reduction targets. These past efforts demonstrate that international cooperation can achieve meaningful results, but also highlight the need for stronger commitments from all nations to meet the agreement's ambitious goals."

## Paragraph 2: Proposed Solutions

This paragraph outlines your country's proposed solutions and policy positions. This is where you demonstrate constructive thinking and offer concrete proposals.

### Structure

**(a)** **Topic Sentence**: How will your country solve the problem? What actions does your delegation support?

**(b)** **Context**: Why will your solution be effective? What makes this approach superior to alternatives?

**(c)** **Evidence**: Support your proposals with:

**(1)** Statistics and data

**(2)** Historical precedents

**(3)** Expert opinions or studies

**(4)** Success stories from similar initiatives

**(d)** **Analysis**: How does your solution work in practice? What mechanisms will ensure its success?

**(e)** **Concluding Sentence**: Connect your proposed solution back to your overall argument.

### Example Paragraph

> "Germany proposes the establishment of a Green Technology Transfer Fund to assist developing nations in adopting renewable energy infrastructure. By contributing $500 million annually and encouraging other developed nations to match this commitment, the international community can accelerate the global transition to clean energy while ensuring that economic development remains accessible to all nations. This approach builds on successful models like the Green Climate Fund while addressing the specific barriers that have limited technology transfer in the past."

## Conclusion

Wrap up your position paper with a clear restatement of your stance and key proposals.

### Elements to Include

**(a)** Restate your stance clearly and confidently

**(b)** Highlight one or two key parts of your solution

**(c)** Express willingness to work with other nations

**(d)** End with a forward-looking statement

### Example Conclusion

By supporting the Green Technology Transfer Fund and strengthening the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the international community can make meaningful progress toward a sustainable future. Germany stands ready to work with all willing partners to achieve these goals."
