In every Model UN committee, there's one delegate—the one who dominates every moderated caucus, raises their placard before the chair even finishes speaking, and manages to sneak their name into every working paper before the unmod even begins. They're loud. They're confident. And they think that's how you win.

It's not.

It's easy to walk away from committee with the impression that success in Model UN means making sure everyone knows your opinion—because you said it the most. And to be fair, confidence in public speaking is a huge part of MUN. But after dozens of conferences, wins, losses, and hours watching committee dynamics unfold, I've learned something simple: louder doesn't mean better.

When I started doing MUN, I thought I had to be assertive and outspoken to succeed. I jumped into the speaker's list early, pushed my ideas into every draft resolution, and interrupted people to make sure I was remembered—not them. But over time, I began noticing something. The delegates who made the biggest impact—the ones who actually moved committee, who built real coalitions, who introduced thoughtful, original solutions—weren't the ones who talked the most.

They were the ones who listened.

They spoke when it mattered. They built their influence steadily and quietly. They said things with relevance and precision, not just volume.

Take a delegate I worked with in a crisis committee last year. She barely spoke during the first two sessions—not because she was unprepared, but because she was watching. She studied how blocs were forming, who interrupted others, and who handled pushback well. Then, when she finally spoke, she reframed the entire direction of the crisis. By the end of committee, she had become one of the most respected voices in the room. Not only did she win an award—she won two.

There's a big difference between taking up space and earning space.

Model UN is a simulation of diplomacy. And in diplomacy, volume isn't leadership. In fact, some of the world's most effective negotiators lead with restraint, empathy, and timing. You don't always need to be the one speaking to be the one in control.

Of course you should speak. But focus on what you're saying—when you're saying it, what came before it, and what could come of it. Think about the conversations your comments could spark. Then, when you do speak, you'll be ready—and your words will matter more than if you had spoken just to speak.

Model UN isn't about yelling matches. That's not diplomacy.

When you say something important, people know.
When you say something important, you'll know.

Make your time count. The best delegates aren't always the loudest.
They're the ones who listen—
and then speak.
