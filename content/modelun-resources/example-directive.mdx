## Key Features of This Directive

### 1. Creative Title (Acronym)

The directive uses an acronym that spells out a meaningful word: **DUSTIN** (Developing Unforgettable Simulations for Thoughtful International Negotiations). This makes the directive memorable and shows creativity.

### 2. Clear Operative Structure

Each main clause starts with a strong action verb in the present tense:
- "Create"
- "Establish"
- "Call upon"

### 3. Nested Sub-Clauses

The directive uses a logical hierarchy:
- **Numbers (1, 2, 3)** for main operative clauses
- **Letters (a, b, c)** for sub-points
- **Roman numerals (i, ii)** for further details

### 4. Specific and Actionable

Each clause contains specific, actionable items rather than vague statements:
- "Two conferences per year, one in the spring and one in the fall"
- "Students in 5-8th grade"
- "Dustin Simon will create a spreadsheet"

### 5. Addresses Implementation

The directive considers practical implementation:
- Who will do what
- Backup plans (e.g., sending physical mail if emails go to spam)
- Structure and organization (the Secretariat system)
