## Introduction

Effective country research is the foundation of successful Model UN participation. This guide will help you understand your assigned country's positions, interests, and behavior in the international community. By taking the time to deeply research your country, you'll be able to represent it authentically and engage meaningfully with other delegates.

## Step 1: Basic Country Profile

Start by gathering fundamental information about your country. This background knowledge will inform everything else you research and help you understand why your country takes certain positions.

### Geography

Begin by understanding where your country is located in the world and who its neighbors are. Examine what natural resources your country possesses, as these often drive economic and foreign policy decisions. Consider what climate and geographical challenges your country faces, such as droughts, flooding, or lack of arable land. Finally, think about your country's strategic importance—does it control important waterways, sit at a crossroads of trade routes, or border regions of conflict?

### Demographics

Research your country's population size and whether it is growing, shrinking, or aging. Understand the ethnic and religious composition of your country, as this often influences domestic politics and foreign relations. Learn what languages are spoken and which are official. Consider the distribution between urban and rural populations, as this affects development priorities and economic policies.

### Economy

Determine your country's GDP and whether it is classified as developed, developing, or a Least Developed Country (LDC). Identify the major industries and primary exports, as these shape trade relationships and economic interests. Research the key economic challenges your country faces, such as unemployment, inflation, or debt. Understand your country's most important trade relationships and economic partnerships.

### Government

Learn about your country's political system—is it a democracy, monarchy, one-party state, or something else? Know who the current leaders are, including the head of state and head of government. Research the major political parties and their platforms if applicable. Consider how stable the government is and whether there have been recent changes in leadership or political direction.

## Step 2: Foreign Policy Research

Once you understand your country's basic profile, dive deeper into how it interacts with the rest of the world. Foreign policy is shaped by geography, history, economics, and ideology.

### Alliances and Blocs

Identify which regional organizations your country belongs to, such as the European Union, African Union, ASEAN, or Organization of American States. Research whether your country is part of any military alliances like NATO or collective security arrangements. Examine economic partnerships and trade agreements your country has signed. Understand which voting blocs your country aligns with in the United Nations, as this will help you identify natural allies in committee.

### Key Relationships

Identify your country's major allies—which countries does it cooperate with most closely on security, economic, and diplomatic matters? Research historical adversaries and understand why tensions exist or existed. Know your country's most important trade partners and what goods and services flow between them. If your country receives foreign aid, know who the major donors are; if it provides aid, know where that assistance goes.

### UN Engagement

Research how your country has voted on General Assembly resolutions, particularly those related to your committee's topic. Examine which major treaties and conventions your country has ratified, signed but not ratified, or refused to sign. Understand your country's contributions to the UN budget and whether it is a major funder or recipient of UN programs. Learn whether your country participates in peacekeeping operations and where those missions are deployed.

## Step 3: Topic-Specific Research

After building a general understanding of your country, focus on how it relates specifically to your committee's topic. This is where your research becomes most directly useful for debate.

### Domestic Impact

Examine how the issue your committee is discussing affects your country directly. Research what domestic policies your country has implemented to address this issue at home. Gather relevant statistics about your country—for example, if discussing climate change, know your country's emissions levels; if discussing education, know literacy rates and school enrollment figures.

### Historical Position

Research how your country has voted on past UN resolutions related to this topic, as this reveals consistent patterns in policy. Find statements your country's representatives have made in UN forums about this issue. Know which relevant treaties your country has signed or rejected and understand why. Research what actions your country has taken in the past to address this issue, both domestically and internationally.

### Current Policy

Find official government statements about the topic from recent years. Research any recent initiatives or programs your country has launched related to the issue. Understand what resources your country has committed to addressing this problem. Identify your country's stated priorities and goals regarding this topic.

## Step 4: Research Sources

Knowing where to find reliable information is just as important as knowing what to look for. Use a variety of sources to get a complete picture.

### Official Sources

The United Nations website (UN.org) is your best source for resolutions, voting records, and official UN documents. Your country's Permanent Mission to the UN often has a website with statements and position papers. Government websites with .gov domains provide official policy information directly from the source. Look for statements from your country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for diplomatic positions.

### News Sources

International news organizations like BBC, Reuters, and the Associated Press provide balanced coverage of global events. Reading newspapers from your assigned country helps you understand how issues are perceived domestically. Regional news sources offer perspectives that international outlets might miss. Academic journals provide in-depth analysis and historical context.

### Data Sources

The World Bank provides comprehensive economic data and development indicators for nearly every country. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) offers detailed economic analysis and forecasts. The World Health Organization (WHO) has health statistics and policy information. The UNDP Human Development Index ranks countries by quality of life indicators beyond just economic measures.

### Think Tanks

The Council on Foreign Relations provides accessible analysis of international issues with a US perspective. Chatham House (the Royal Institute of International Affairs) offers British and European perspectives on global affairs. The Brookings Institution publishes in-depth policy research on a wide range of topics. Look for think tanks based in your country's region for perspectives closer to home.

## Step 5: Understanding Positions

The most important part of research is understanding not just what your country's positions are, but why it holds them. This deeper understanding allows you to argue persuasively and respond to unexpected situations.

### Historical Context

Consider how colonial history has shaped your country's worldview and relationships with other nations. Research past conflicts your country has experienced and how they influence current security concerns. Understand the cultural influences that have shaped your country's values and perspectives. Examine your country's economic development path and how it affects views on issues like trade, aid, and environmental policy.

### National Interests

Identify your country's primary security concerns—what threats does it face, and how does it seek to address them? Understand your country's economic priorities, including the industries it wants to protect and the markets it wants to access. Consider how your country seeks to maintain or expand its regional influence. Think about how domestic politics shape foreign policy—leaders often take international positions that appeal to their domestic audiences.

### Ideological Factors

Understand your country's political ideology and how it shapes its approach to international cooperation and sovereignty. Consider how religious beliefs or the separation of church and state influence policy positions. Research the cultural values that are important in your country and how they affect views on issues like human rights, gender equality, or family policy. Understand your country's development philosophy—does it favor state-led development, free markets, or something in between?

## Step 6: Finding Your Bloc

In Model UN, delegates rarely work alone. Understanding which countries share your interests helps you find allies and build coalitions.

### Geographic Blocs

The United Nations organizes countries into five regional groups for electoral and organizational purposes. The African Group includes all 54 African nations and often coordinates on development and post-colonial issues. The Asia-Pacific Group is the largest and most diverse, spanning from the Middle East to the Pacific Islands. The Eastern European Group includes former Soviet states and countries that were part of the Eastern Bloc. The Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC) coordinates on regional issues and often shares perspectives on development. The Western European and Others Group (WEOG) includes Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, and often aligns on human rights and democratic governance issues.

### Issue-Based Groups

Beyond geographic blocs, countries form coalitions around shared interests. The G77 plus China is a coalition of developing nations that often coordinate on economic and development issues. The European Union member states frequently speak and vote as a bloc on many issues. The Arab League coordinates positions on Middle Eastern affairs and issues affecting Muslim-majority countries. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) work together on climate change and ocean issues that threaten their very existence. Landlocked Developing Countries face unique challenges in trade and development and often coordinate their positions accordingly.
