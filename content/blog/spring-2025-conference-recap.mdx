This spring, JAMUN hosted our most ambitious Model UN conference to date. With over 200 delegates from 25 different schools, the energy in the building was electric from start to finish.

## A Weekend of Diplomacy

The conference kicked off Friday evening with an opening ceremony that set the tone for the weekend. Our Secretary-General delivered an inspiring speech about the power of youth voices in shaping global policy.

> "You're not just practicing diplomacy here—you're building the skills that will help you make real change in the world."

Delegates were assigned to one of eight committees, each tackling pressing global issues:

- **Security Council**: Crisis simulation on regional conflicts
- **ECOSOC**: Sustainable development and poverty reduction
- **WHO**: Global health preparedness
- **UNHRC**: Refugee rights and humanitarian aid
- **Environmental Assembly**: Climate action strategies
- **Disarmament Committee**: Nuclear non-proliferation
- **Historical Crisis**: Cold War scenarios
- **Press Corps**: Journalism and media coverage

## Highlights from the Committees

### Security Council Excellence

The Security Council faced a rapidly evolving crisis scenario that tested delegates' ability to think on their feet. The winning delegation from Lincoln Middle School crafted a resolution that balanced immediate humanitarian needs with long-term stability considerations.

### Environmental Assembly Innovation

Perhaps the most creative solutions came from our Environmental Assembly, where delegates proposed a youth-led global climate monitoring network. The idea was so compelling that several delegates have expressed interest in making it a reality.

## Award Winners

We're proud to recognize the outstanding delegates who went above and beyond:

| Award | Recipient | School |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Best Delegate | Sarah Chen | Jefferson MS |
| Outstanding Delegate | Marcus Johnson | Roosevelt Academy |
| Honorable Mention | Priya Patel | Washington Middle |
| Best Position Paper | Team Lebanon | Lincoln MS |

## What Delegates Said

The feedback from participants has been overwhelmingly positive:

- "This was my first MUN conference and I was nervous, but everyone was so welcoming. I can't wait for the next one!"
- "I learned more about international relations in one weekend than I have all year in school."
- "The chairs were amazing—they kept us engaged and helped us improve throughout the conference."

## Looking Ahead

The success of this conference has us excited for what's next. We're already planning our Fall 2025 conference, which we hope to make even bigger and better.

### How to Get Involved

If your school didn't participate this time, there's still plenty of opportunity to join the JAMUN community:

1. **Register for Fall 2025** - Early bird registration opens in June
2. **Start a club** - We provide resources to help you launch MUN at your school
3. **Volunteer** - High school and college students can apply to chair committees
4. **Donate** - Help us provide scholarships for students who need financial assistance

## Thank You

None of this would be possible without our incredible team of volunteers, our partner schools, and the generous donors who help us keep registration affordable for everyone.

To all the delegates who participated: you made this conference special. Keep debating, keep learning, and keep pushing for a better world.

See you at the next conference!
