When I competed in Mathletes in middle school, I thought success was all about knowing more formulas than everyone else. I was wrong. The students who consistently win aren't just math whizzes—they're strategic thinkers who approach problems differently.

Here are the strategies that made the biggest difference for me and for the students I now coach.

## Start with What You Know

When you see a tough problem, your first instinct might be to panic. Instead, take a breath and identify what you *do* know.

**Ask yourself:**
- What information does the problem give me?
- What am I trying to find?
- What concepts might be relevant?
- Have I seen something similar before?

Even if you can't solve the whole problem, starting with what you know often reveals the path forward.

## Work Backwards

Some of the trickiest problems become simple when you approach them in reverse. If you know what the answer should look like, work backwards from there.

**Example:** If a problem asks "What value of x makes this equation true?", try plugging in the answer choices to see which one works. This is often faster than solving algebraically.

This strategy is especially powerful in multiple choice sections where you can use the answer choices as a guide.

## Draw It Out

Visual learners already know this, but even if you don't consider yourself "visual," diagrams can unlock solutions that seem impossible with pure algebra.

**When to draw:**
- Geometry problems (obviously)
- Word problems involving motion or distance
- Probability questions
- Number theory problems with patterns

A quick sketch can reveal relationships that aren't obvious from the words alone.

## Look for Patterns

Competition math loves patterns. When you see a sequence, a series, or a repeated operation, there's almost always a pattern hiding underneath.

**Pattern-finding techniques:**
- Write out the first several terms
- Look for differences between consecutive terms
- Check for cycles or repeating elements
- Consider what happens at the boundaries

Once you identify the pattern, you can often jump straight to the answer without computing every step.

## Estimate First

Before diving into calculations, estimate what the answer should be. This serves two purposes:

1. **Sanity check** - If your calculated answer is wildly different from your estimate, you probably made an error
2. **Process of elimination** - You can often rule out answer choices that don't fit your estimate

Good estimation is a skill worth practicing. It builds number sense that helps across all math.

## Manage Your Time

In competition, time management is everything. Here's my recommended approach:

1. **First pass (2-3 minutes per problem):** Answer everything you can solve quickly
2. **Second pass (remaining time):** Return to harder problems
3. **Final check (last 5 minutes):** Verify your answers, especially easy ones where careless errors hide

Don't get stuck on one problem while easier points wait on later pages. This is the most common mistake beginners make.

## Practice Under Pressure

The skills above only work if they're automatic when you're stressed. That means practice—but not just any practice.

**Effective practice looks like:**
- Timed problem sets
- Competition-style formats
- Problems slightly above your comfort level
- Review sessions where you study your mistakes

The goal is to make good problem-solving habits so ingrained that they happen naturally under pressure.

## Building Long-Term Skills

Competition math isn't just about winning trophies (though that's nice too). The problem-solving skills you develop transfer to every area of life.

- Breaking complex problems into manageable pieces
- Staying calm under pressure
- Learning from mistakes
- Thinking creatively when the obvious approach doesn't work

These are skills that will serve you whether you become a mathematician, a doctor, an entrepreneur, or anything else.
