## Understanding Crisis Committees

Crisis committees offer a unique Model UN experience with fast-paced action, individual portfolios, and evolving scenarios.

### How Crisis Differs from GA

| General Assembly | Crisis |
|-----------------|--------|
| Represents countries | Represents individuals |
| Writes resolutions | Writes directives |
| Stable scenario | Evolving crisis |
| Large committees | Smaller committees |
| Formal procedure | Flexible procedure |

### Key Crisis Components

#### Crisis Updates
The crisis staff introduces new developments that delegates must respond to. Stay alert and adapt quickly.

#### Directives
Short documents proposing specific actions. Unlike resolutions, directives are immediate and action-oriented.

#### Crisis Notes (Backroom)
Private communications between delegates and crisis staff. Use these to pursue individual goals and take personal actions.

### Writing Effective Crisis Notes

**Be specific**: Detail exactly what you want to do
**Be realistic**: Actions should match your portfolio's power
**Be creative**: Think outside the box
**Be strategic**: Consider long-term consequences

### Directive Structure

1. **Title**: Clear description of the action
2. **Sponsors**: Who is behind this action
3. **Body**: Specific actions to be taken
4. **Signatures**: Support from committee members

### Crisis Committee Tips

- Read your background guide thoroughly
- Understand your character's motivations and resources
- Build alliances early
- Balance public and private actions
- Respond quickly to crisis updates
