## Letter from the Chair

Dear Delegates,

Welcome to the Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee (SOCHUM) at JAMUN. You're about to tackle one of the most urgent humanitarian crises facing Europe: what happens when millions of displaced people arrive in countries whose housing systems are already strained to the breaking point?

The numbers are staggering. Over 117 million people worldwide are forcibly displaced. Millions have sought refuge in Europe, where they often find themselves trapped in legal limbo, excluded from housing markets, and pushed into a state of "hidden homelessness" that official statistics rarely capture. Meanwhile, Europe's own homeless population continues to grow, creating tensions over scarce resources and testing the limits of the continent's famed social safety nets.

Your challenge is to find solutions that protect the dignity of both refugees and the homeless, while navigating the political realities of nations experiencing "compassion fatigue" and rising anti-immigrant sentiment. This will require creative thinking about housing policy, integration programs, and the very definition of who deserves protection.

Come prepared to debate, negotiate, and build coalitions that can bridge deep divides.

Best regards,

The SOCHUM Dais

## History of the Committee

The Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee—commonly known as SOCHUM or the General Assembly Third Committee—is one of the six main organs of the United Nations General Assembly.[^1] Founded in 1945 alongside the UN itself, SOCHUM was created to tackle the social and humanitarian concerns that world leaders recognized as essential to maintaining global peace.[^2] While committees like DISEC focus on the physical security of states, SOCHUM focuses on the security and dignity of individuals. The underlying belief? Lasting stability is impossible without protecting basic human rights.[^3]

As a General Assembly committee, SOCHUM includes all 193 UN Member States.[^1] This universal representation is vital to its mandate, since the issues it discusses—from the advancement of women and the protection of children to the treatment of refugees and the promotion of fundamental freedoms—require global consensus to implement effectively.[^4] The committee's work draws heavily from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted in 1948, which serves as the foundational document for almost all SOCHUM deliberations.[^5]

The committee's primary responsibility is examining human rights questions and reports from the UN's various special procedures and treaty bodies.[^6] SOCHUM also coordinates closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Human Rights Council (HRC).[^27] Although SOCHUM resolutions are non-binding, they carry significant moral and political weight, setting international standards for how states should treat vulnerable populations.[^28] Through discussions on fighting inequality and ensuring freedoms, SOCHUM serves as the world's most prominent forum for social progress and the defense of human dignity.[^29]

## Statement of the Problem

Forced displacement and homelessness collide to form one of the most pressing humanitarian challenges facing Europe today.[^10] As of mid-2025, the UNHCR reports that over 117 million people worldwide are forcibly displaced, with millions seeking refuge within European borders.[^30] The European Union and its neighbors have long prided themselves on robust social safety nets and a commitment to human rights—but the rapid influx of refugees has strained these systems to their breaking points.[^16]

The problem is two-fold. First, there's a physical lack of adequate shelter for those arriving from conflict zones. Second, systemic barriers prevent these individuals from transitioning into long-term, stable housing.[^7] For many refugees, reaching the "safety" of Europe doesn't mark the end of their struggle—it marks the beginning of a new period of "hidden homelessness."[^6] This crisis isn't merely a logistical failure of bed-space. It's a deep-seated humanitarian issue involving discrimination, legal limbo, and economic exclusion.[^15]

### The Displacement Surge

The scale of modern displacement in Europe is unprecedented in the post-WWII era. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, which escalated in early 2022, led to the displacement of over 6.3 million Ukrainians across Europe by 2025. Initially, European nations met this surge with an outpouring of solidarity, using private homes and emergency government grants to house millions. However, as the conflict persists, "compassion fatigue" has begun to set in. Host nations like Poland, Germany, and the Czech Republic—which together host nearly 3 million Ukrainians—have begun reassessing their financial support programs.

This shift has direct consequences for homelessness. In the UK alone, there has been a 239% increase in refugees requiring homelessness support from local authorities after being evicted from temporary government-funded accommodation. When emergency funding dries up or temporary protection statuses are reassessed, refugees—many of them women and children—find themselves with no legal right to stay in their current housing and no financial means to enter the private market.

### Administrative Barriers

One of the most significant vulnerabilities in the humanitarian sector lies in the administrative delay in processing asylum claims. At the end of 2025, over 80,000 people in the UK and hundreds of thousands more across the EU were waiting for initial decisions on their asylum applications. During this waiting period, which can last years, many seekers are caught in legal limbo where they're prohibited from working and have "No Recourse to Public Funds" (NRPF).

This status effectively mandates destitution. Without the right to earn a living, asylum seekers depend entirely on meager government stipends. In many European cities, these stipends don't even cover basic rental costs. Making matters worse, "Hostile Environment" policies (such as the UK's Immigration Acts of 2014 and 2016) require private landlords to check the immigration status of every tenant. The result? Widespread "preemptive discrimination," where landlords refuse to rent to any non-national or ethnic minority to avoid potential heavy fines—even if the individual has a legal right to be there.

### Structural Failures in the Housing Market

The refugee crisis has coincided with a broader European housing crisis characterized by skyrocketing prices and a dwindling supply of social housing. This creates a "perfect storm" of economic exclusion. Migrants and refugees are disproportionately represented in the bottom half of the income distribution, making them the first victims of a financialized housing market where priority is given to those who can pay the highest rent.

Consider this: 25% of non-EU citizens in Europe spend more than 40% of their disposable income on housing, compared to just 9% of national citizens. This "rent overburden" leaves no margin for error. A single missed payment or a change in government policy can result in immediate homelessness. Moreover, social housing stocks are often built for standard family sizes, leaving larger refugee families or unaccompanied minors to congregate in substandard, overcrowded properties that lack heating, proper sanitation, and safety.

### Systemic Discrimination and Xenophobia

Beyond economic and legal hurdles lies the persistent issue of racial and national discrimination. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) has documented that refugees from Africa and the Middle East often face steeper barriers than those from European neighbors. For example, while Ukrainian refugees were granted immediate "Temporary Protection" and access to the labor market, asylum seekers from countries like Afghanistan (42,000 claims in early 2025) and Syria often face years of detention and restricted movement.

This differential treatment is often fueled by disinformation and rising xenophobic sentiment. In some Member States, refugees are blamed for the very housing shortages actually caused by lack of government investment and high construction costs. This social tension creates a hostile environment that discourages refugees from seeking help from authorities—fearing deportation or detention—and pushes them further into the shadows of "hidden homelessness."

### The Limbo of Unaccompanied Minors

A particularly heartbreaking aspect of this problem involves unaccompanied children. In the past 12 months, nearly 4,000 children sought protection in the UK alone. These children are extremely vulnerable to exploitation by organized crime groups if they're not immediately placed in secure, supportive housing. Many of these minors are granted short-term leave that expires after 2.5 years, leaving them in a state of constant anxiety about their future. Without a permanent housing solution, these children struggle to integrate into schools or form the social connections necessary for long-term stability, risking a "lost generation" of displaced youth.

The challenge for SOCHUM delegates is to move beyond short-term "tent cities" and emergency shelters. The committee must find ways to harmonize immigration policies with housing rights, ensuring that human dignity isn't sacrificed in the name of border security or administrative efficiency.

## History of the Problem

The historical roots of homelessness and displacement in Europe are deeply intertwined with the continent's experience of 20th-century warfare. Following World War II, Europe faced a staggering crisis: an estimated 40 million people uprooted and homeless.[^2] This catastrophe led to the creation of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and later the UNHCR.[^8] The international community quickly realized that temporary "camps" for displaced persons could not be a permanent solution—and so the 1951 Refugee Convention was born. This landmark document defined a refugee and established the principle of non-refoulement: the idea that no person should be returned to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom.[^18]

While the 1951 Convention was initially limited to European refugees from the post-war era, the 1967 Protocol removed these geographic and time-bound restrictions, acknowledging that displacement was a global and enduring phenomenon.[^27] Despite these legal foundations, the actual provision of housing has remained a matter of national sovereignty rather than international law. As a result, the history of this problem is marked by tension between international human rights obligations and local economic limitations, leading to the systemic gaps in shelter that persist today.[^14]

### From Post-War Resettlement to the Dublin Regulation

In the decades following World War II, many European nations developed robust welfare states with high levels of public housing.[^19] But the legal framework for managing refugees began to shift toward "deterrence" in the 1990s. The 1990 Dublin Convention (and the later Dublin Regulations) established a simple rule: a refugee must apply for asylum in the first European country they enter.[^18] This was designed to prevent "asylum shopping," but it created an unfair burden on "frontline" states like Greece, Italy, and Spain.[^5]

Because these frontline states often lacked the financial resources to provide adequate housing for everyone arriving at their shores, thousands of refugees were left to sleep in parks or "transit zones."[^12] This birthed the phenomenon of "refugees in orbit"—individuals who were technically under European protection but had no physical home, moving from one country to another only to be sent back to the overcrowded shelters of their first point of entry.[^17]

### The Rise of Tent Cities

The modern era of this problem was defined by the 2015 European Migrant Crisis, when over one million people—primarily fleeing the Syrian Civil War—crossed the Mediterranean.[^23] This surge exposed the total lack of preparedness within the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). In city after city, images of "tent cities" in public parks became commonplace. Governments responded by building massive reception centers, such as Greece's Moria camp, which became infamous for overcrowding and poor living conditions.[^28]

Moria, originally built for 3,000 people, eventually housed over 20,000 before it was destroyed by fire in 2020. This period proved that the "reception center" model often functioned as a form of "institutionalized homelessness," where people were kept in limbo without the ability to work, integrate, or find permanent housing.[^31] It also saw the rise of restrictive border fences across the Balkans and Hungary, signaling a shift toward "Fortress Europe" where security was prioritized over humanitarian housing.[^4]

### Examples of Housing Policy Failures

History shows that even well-meaning policies can lead to homelessness if they aren't comprehensive. For example, the UK's "move-on" period historically gave refugees just 28 days to find a home and a job once their asylum was granted.[^14] In a housing market with high deposits and long waiting lists, 28 days proved impossible for many, leading to a direct "pipeline" from government support to street homelessness.[^21] Similarly, in France, the dismantling of the "Calais Jungle" in 2016 displaced nearly 7,000 people. While the government aimed to move them into formal centers, many returned to the streets of Paris and Calais due to a lack of long-term integration support.[^28] These historical examples serve as a warning to delegates: providing a temporary bed is not the same as solving homelessness.

## Past Actions

The United Nations has long recognized that the right to adequate housing is a fundamental component of human dignity—and a prerequisite for enjoying all other social and cultural rights. Over the decades, SOCHUM, in coordination with bodies like UN-Habitat and the UNHCR, has evolved from a reactive posture (managing emergency camps) to a more proactive, rights-based approach.[^32] While the primary responsibility for housing lies with Member States, the UN has acted as a normative leader, establishing international standards and providing the technical expertise necessary to prevent mass destitution among displaced populations.[^7] Past actions have focused on three main pillars: codifying housing as a human right, implementing large-scale shelter programs in crisis zones, and creating global frameworks to share the burden of refugee hosting more equitably.[^5]

Despite these efforts, progress has been uneven. While some programs have successfully transitioned thousands of families into permanent homes, others have struggled with chronic underfunding and a lack of political will from host governments.[^6] The history of UN action in this field is a testament to the power of international cooperation, but also a stark reminder of the limits of non-binding resolutions when faced with national economic crises and shifting political landscapes.[^8]

### Codifying Adequate Housing

A cornerstone of UN action has been the legal definition and protection of housing rights. SOCHUM was instrumental in the passage of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in 1966, where Article 11 formally recognized "the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing, and housing."[^3] To further refine this, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued General Comment No. 4 in 1991, which clarified that "adequate housing" must include legal security of tenure, availability of services, affordability, and habitability.[^7]

In more recent years, the UN has focused on the "financialization" of housing—the trend where housing is treated as a commodity for profit rather than a social good.[^16] The appointment of a Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing in 2000 has allowed the UN to conduct country-specific visits and issue "communications" to governments when refugees are threatened with eviction.[^19] Reports presented to SOCHUM have highlighted how European austerity measures post-2008 disproportionately pushed migrants and refugees into homelessness, leading to UN recommendations for "eviction bans" and increased social housing investment.[^25] These normative actions provide delegates with the legal vocabulary needed to hold states accountable for the "hidden homelessness" occurring within their borders.

### Operational Shelter Responses

Beyond legal frameworks, the UN has taken direct operational action to provide physical shelter. The UNHCR's "Global Shelter Cluster," co-led with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), has managed hundreds of shelter interventions across the European region.[^23] A significant historical example is the UN's response to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Georgia, where the UN-Habitat "Shelter Projects" provided a blueprint for moving people out of collective centers and into rehabilitated public buildings.[^28]

In the wake of the 2015-2016 crisis, the UN pivoted toward "Cash-Based Interventions" (CBIs). Instead of building new camps, the UNHCR began providing refugees with debit cards and cash grants to pay rent in the private market. In Greece, the "ESTIA" program (Emergency Support to Integration and Accommodation) provided over 25,000 housing places in apartments for vulnerable asylum seekers. This marked a major shift in UN strategy: moving away from isolating refugees in rural camps and toward integrating them into urban communities. But as funding for ESTIA was handed over to national governments, many programs were scaled back—highlighting the difficulty of sustaining UN-led successes without permanent state commitment.[^30]

### The Global Compact on Refugees

Perhaps the most ambitious past action was the adoption of the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) by the General Assembly in December 2018. The GCR was designed to address the very "Dublin Regulation" failures mentioned earlier by creating a system for more predictable sharing of responsibility.[^10] One of its key objectives is to ease the pressures on host countries and lower refugee reliance on external factors. This framework led to the first-ever Global Refugee Forum in 2019, where over 1,400 pledges were made by states and private organizations to fund housing and integration.[^15]

A unique outcome of the GCR has been the UN's support for "Municipal Alliances." Recognizing that cities are on the front lines of homelessness, UN-Habitat and the UNHCR launched the "Inclusive Cities" project.[^18] In Europe, this has seen the UN partnering directly with mayors in cities like Berlin, Barcelona, and Gdansk to bypass national-level political gridlock. These cities have pledged to provide "Sanctuary" and access to local housing registers regardless of a refugee's national status. By empowering local governments, the UN has attempted to create a "bottom-up" solution to homelessness, though these efforts are often hampered by the fact that local cities still rely on national governments for the bulk of their funding and legal authority.[^14]

## Possible Solutions

### Implementing "Housing First"

The most effective modern strategy for ending homelessness is the "Housing First" model. Traditional systems often require homeless individuals to solve other problems—unemployment, mental health issues, addiction—before they're considered "ready" for a house. Housing First flips this logic: provide a permanent home immediately, combined with voluntary support services.[^12] This approach has seen immense success in Finland, where it has nearly eliminated street homelessness. For refugees in Europe, a continental "Housing First" initiative would mean transitioning from large-scale reception centers to scattered-site housing within local communities.[^16]

Delegates should consider proposing a "European Housing Solidarity Fund" (EHSF). This fund would provide low-interest loans and grants to Member States that commit to renovating abandoned buildings or public assets specifically for refugee "Housing First" programs.[^13] By rehabilitating existing infrastructure rather than building new camps, states can reduce the environmental impact and the social stigma associated with refugee housing. Furthermore, the UN can facilitate technical exchanges where Finnish experts train municipal authorities in other European nations on how to manage these programs.[^26] This solution addresses the structural failure of the housing market by taking housing for vulnerable groups out of the speculative private market and placing it under social management.

### Enabling Economic Self-Reliance

A primary driver of refugee homelessness is the legal "limbo" that prevents asylum seekers from working. When individuals depend on state stipends for years, they lose their professional skills and their savings, making them unable to compete in the housing market once their status is finally granted. A critical solution is "Right to Work Reform," which would mandate that all asylum seekers be granted work permits if their application has not been processed within 90 days.[^17] This would allow refugees to contribute to the local economy and save money for rental deposits—effectively preventing homelessness before it begins.[^22]

Beyond work rights, the committee should discuss creating a "European Digital Identity for Displaced Persons." This digital passport, built on secure blockchain technology, would allow refugees to store their educational credentials, rental history, and identity documents in a way that's recognized across European borders.[^26] One of the biggest hurdles to housing is the lack of "rental credit" or local history. A UN-verified digital identity would allow a refugee moving from Greece to Germany to prove their reliability to a landlord—reducing administrative barriers and empowering refugees to navigate the private market with the same tools as local citizens.[^31]

### Expanding Community Hosting Programs

The 2022 response to the Ukrainian crisis proved that the private sector and civil society have a massive, untapped capacity for housing. Programs like "Homes for Ukraine" in the UK and similar initiatives in Germany saw hundreds of thousands of private citizens open their homes to displaced persons.[^29] To solve the broader homelessness crisis, the UN should work to formalize and expand these "Community Sponsorship" models to include refugees of all nationalities. This prevents the "compassion fatigue" seen in government-only models by distributing responsibility across the entire social fabric.[^24]

Delegates could propose a "Global Refugee Hosting Tax Incentive" framework. Under this proposal, the UN would provide guidelines for Member States to offer tax credits or utility subsidies to citizens and small businesses that provide stable housing to refugees for a minimum of two years.[^20] To ensure safety and dignity, these programs would be overseen by a "Community Hosting Oversight Body" composed of UN-Habitat and local NGOs, which would conduct regular inspections and provide mediation services between hosts and guests. This model not only provides immediate beds but also facilitates social integration and language learning, which are the ultimate defenses against long-term homelessness. By shifting the narrative from "burden" to "community contribution," this solution tackles xenophobia and social exclusion directly.[^26]

### Strengthening Sanctuary Networks

Finally, the crisis must be addressed at the local level. Sanctuary Cities have shown that local governments are often more willing to protect housing rights than national governments. But these cities need a legal and financial "shield" to operate effectively. A key solution is "Decoupling Social Services from Immigration Enforcement." Currently, many homeless refugees avoid shelters because they fear shelter staff will report them to immigration authorities.[^21] By passing a UN-backed resolution that classifies "Emergency Shelter and Basic Housing" as "Firewalled Services"—meaning no data can be shared with border police—nations can ensure that the most vulnerable populations come out of the shadows.[^27]

To support this, the UN should establish a "Direct Municipal Funding Mechanism." Historically, UN funds go to national treasuries, where they can be diverted or delayed. This new mechanism would allow the UNHCR to grant funds directly to city councils for creating "Inclusive Housing Hubs."[^23] These hubs would provide not just a bed, but also legal aid, healthcare, and employment training under one roof. By empowering mayors and local leaders, the international community can bypass national political stalemates and ensure that the "Right to the City" is a reality for everyone, regardless of where they were born. This localized approach ensures that solutions are tailored to the specific housing market and cultural context of each city, leading to more resilient and integrated urban environments.[^25]

## Potential Blocs

The issue of homelessness and refugees divides the international community along lines of geographical proximity, economic philosophy, and the perceived balance between national security and human rights. While all nations in SOCHUM nominally support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, they fundamentally disagree on two questions: Who should bear the financial burden of housing displaced populations? And should housing be treated as a guaranteed social right or a conditional benefit based on legal status? These disagreements split the committee into distinct blocs, each prioritizing different aspects of the crisis—from those demanding more equitable burden-sharing to those emphasizing the sovereignty of national border controls.

### The Frontline States (Southern Europe and Mediterranean)

The "Frontline" bloc faces the most immediate pressure regarding the physical housing of arrivals. Because of the Dublin Regulation, these nations are often the legal "entry points" responsible for the thousands of refugees arriving via sea routes. Consequently, their priority is mandatory burden-sharing and the decentralization of reception centers.[^29]

These nations often find themselves in a paradoxical position: they advocate for increased UN funding for emergency shelters but also call for the relocation of refugees to wealthier northern states. They are the primary proponents of "EU-wide solidarity mechanisms" and often criticize Northern Europe for "offloading" the humanitarian responsibility onto states with weaker social safety nets. Their policy focus is on the operational side—securing funds for large-scale housing projects and medical facilities in port cities.[^21]

### The Major Host Nations (Central and Western Europe)

Nations in Central and Western Europe form a bloc that hosts the largest raw numbers of refugees in terms of total population residing within their borders. Poland, in particular, became a key leader of this bloc following the 2022 Ukrainian crisis. These nations are generally supportive of human rights-based solutions like "Housing First," but they are also the most vocal about the "economic sustainability" of these programs.[^11]

This bloc is increasingly concerned with "secondary movement"—refugees moving from frontline states into their territories seeking better housing and job markets. Their position emphasizes long-term integration and employment. While they are often the largest financial contributors to UN housing funds, they also face significant domestic pressure to restrict access to social welfare to prevent "pull factors."[^28] They advocate for solutions that include private sponsorship and community hosting to relieve the burden on the state.

### The Transit States and Sovereignty Advocates

A distinct group of nations views the refugee-homelessness crisis primarily through the lens of border security and national sovereignty. This bloc argues that providing high-quality housing and easy access to social services acts as a "magnet" for illegal migration.[^17] Their strategy is often one of deterrence, characterized by restrictive housing policies and the use of transit zones rather than integrated urban housing.

In SOCHUM, these nations typically resist any resolution that mandates a minimum standard of social housing for refugees that exceeds the standard for their own citizens. They emphasize that homelessness is a domestic policy issue and that the UN's role should be limited to voluntary humanitarian aid rather than the enforcement of a "Right to the City." They are often skeptical of "Sanctuary City" initiatives, believing local governments should not be able to bypass national immigration laws.[^14]

### The Humanitarian Reformers (The Nordic and "Regulator" Class)

This bloc represents the "gold standard" of social welfare models. Having pioneered the "Housing First" approach, these nations advocate for a radical shift in how the UN manages homelessness.[^15] They believe housing is an absolute right that should be decoupled from immigration status. Their position? The current European crisis is a "crisis of policy," not a crisis of resources.

The Humanitarian Reformers push for resolutions that emphasize the vulnerability of specific groups, such as unaccompanied minors and LGBTQ+ refugees, who are at the highest risk of street homelessness.[^16] They often support the "Municipal Alliances" model, arguing that direct funding to cities is more efficient than national-level grants. While they are smaller in number, they exert significant moral influence in the committee and often act as mediators between the Frontline states and the Sovereignty bloc.

### The Global South and Non-European Observers

While the topic is centered on Europe, the Global South plays a vital role as observers and critics. Turkey, which hosts more refugees than any European nation, often highlights what it perceives as the "hypocrisy" of European nations complaining about housing shortages.[^12] This bloc pushes for a "Global Equality" approach, arguing that if Europe wants to solve its homelessness issue, it must also invest in the stability and housing infrastructure of the nations where the refugees originate. Their position is that European homelessness is a symptom of a larger global failure to share the humanitarian burden fairly between the developed and developing world.[^21]
