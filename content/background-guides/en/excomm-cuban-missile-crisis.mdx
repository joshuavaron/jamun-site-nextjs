## Letter from the Chair

Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to SOCHUM at JAMUN! This committee promises to be an engaging and rewarding experience as we address the pressing humanitarian issues of homelessness and refugee displacement in Europe.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,

Joshua Varon

Founder, JAMUN

## Structure and Mechanics

Thirteenth Day: The Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962 is a continuous crisis committee. We understand that many delegates may be new to this specialized format, so this section explains the general structure, flow, and expectations of the committee.

This committee operates as a **continuous crisis**. Instead of following a traditional parliamentary format for the entire conference, we use the crisis format for every session. A crisis committee is divided into two main areas: the **front room** and the **back room**. The front room is where formal debate happens—you'll write group directives and respond to sudden news updates. The back room is the engine of the committee, where staff process the private actions you take through crisis notes.

Think of a crisis committee as a repeating cycle. This cycle usually begins with a **crisis break** (a news update or event), followed by debate, the writing of directives, and finally, voting on those directives. Once a directive passes or fails, the Crisis Directors and back-room staff prepare a new crisis break based on those results, and the cycle begins again.

In practice, our first session will begin with an initial crisis break that introduces the immediate threats facing the United States in October 1962. Early on, these updates will focus on the historical problems described later in this guide. As the committee progresses, however, the breaks will be driven by the actions you take in the back room. You influence the world by writing private notes to the back room.

While the committee works together in the front room to solve problems through **directives**—targeted, group solutions—you will also be pursuing your own individual goals. To pass directives, you'll use classic Model UN skills: giving persuasive speeches, debating in moderated caucuses, and negotiating with other delegates in unmoderated caucuses. The back-room staff monitors these debates and will design the story of the committee to match the directives you choose to pass.

Every delegate should arrive with a clear goal for their specific character. These goals don't necessarily have to match the goals of the whole committee and should be something you can realistically work toward over our five sessions. You'll use your private crisis notes to put these plans into motion. We strongly suggest outlining your primary goal in your very first crisis note.

Generally, these notes should be written in character and addressed to a logical contact—a deputy, a personal assistant, or a family member. They should contain clear, specific instructions for tasks that help you reach your goal. The more logical and clear your plan is, the better your Assistant Chairs can help you succeed.

In the early sessions, focus on gathering resources and building a foundation for your plans. A helpful rule of thumb: make sure you have the necessary finances, infrastructure, and manpower secured in your notes before you attempt a major move. Always consider the historical context and your character's actual reach. For example, since this is 1962, you cannot use modern technology like the internet or GPS—those didn't exist yet.

Your ultimate goal with notes is to influence the front room debate. If your private actions are significant or disruptive enough, they may even trigger a full crisis break for the entire committee to deal with.

We're excited to see how you handle these high-stakes mechanics and use your resources creatively. Think outside the box as you face the challenges of the Cold War. Before we meet, we recommend checking the MUNUC website to get familiar with standard crisis terminology. If you have any questions about how this works, please feel free to ask!

## History of the Problem

### The Monroe Doctrine

To understand why the presence of missiles in Cuba in 1962 felt like an existential threat to the United States, we need to look back nearly 140 years to the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. Declared by President James Monroe, this policy stated that any intervention by external powers in the politics of the Americas was a potentially hostile act against the U.S. For over a century, the United States viewed the Western Hemisphere as its protected sphere of influence. Throughout the early 20th century, the U.S. intervened frequently in Caribbean and Latin American affairs to ensure stability and protect American business interests, particularly in the sugar and fruit industries.[^9]

The relationship between the U.S. and Cuba was uniquely close. Following the Spanish-American War in 1898, the U.S. established the **Platt Amendment**, which gave the American government the legal right to intervene in Cuban affairs whenever it deemed necessary for the preservation of Cuban independence. Cuba was, for all practical purposes, an American protectorate.[^1] By the 1950s, the island was a primary destination for American tourists and a hub for U.S. corporations, which owned nearly 40% of Cuba's sugar production and 90% of its cattle ranches.

However, beneath the surface of the "Pearl of the Antilles" lay deep-seated resentment. The nation was ruled by **Fulgencio Batista**, a military dictator who had seized power in a coup in 1952. While the U.S. government supported Batista as a stable ally against communism, his regime was marked by extreme corruption, police brutality, and a widening gap between the wealthy elite in Havana and the impoverished peasants in the countryside.[^4] For many Cubans, the American presence was not a sign of protection, but a symbol of exploitation.

### The Rise of Castro

The status quo was shattered on January 1, 1959. After years of guerrilla warfare waged from the Sierra Maestra mountains, the **26th of July Movement**, led by a charismatic young lawyer named Fidel Castro, his brother Raúl, and the Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara, successfully overthrew the Batista government.[^7]

Initially, the American reaction was cautious. Castro visited New York and Washington D.C. in April 1959, appearing on talk shows and insisting he was not a communist, but a humanist looking to fix Cuba's broken social system. The honeymoon phase, however, ended almost immediately. Castro began a series of sweeping **Agrarian Reforms**, which involved seizing large tracts of land—much of it owned by U.S. companies—to redistribute to the poor.[^20]

Tensions reached a boiling point in 1960 when Castro nationalized American-owned oil refineries that refused to process Soviet crude oil. In a swift tit-for-tat escalation, President Eisenhower slashed the quota for Cuban sugar imports, essentially cutting off Cuba's main source of income. Castro responded by nationalizing nearly all remaining American property on the island. Feeling backed into a corner and facing a total U.S. trade embargo, Castro looked toward the Soviet Union for survival. By the end of 1960, the USSR had agreed to buy Cuban sugar in exchange for oil, machinery, and—most importantly—military protection.[^34]

To the United States, this was more than a trade deal; it was a direct violation of the Monroe Doctrine. A hostile power had officially gained a foothold just 90 miles from Key West.

### The Domino Theory

This escalation didn't happen in a vacuum. Since 1947, U.S. foreign policy had been dominated by the **Containment Policy**, popularized by diplomat George Kennan. The goal was to contain the Soviet Union and communism within its existing borders to prevent it from spreading. This was reinforced by the **Domino Theory**: the belief that if one nation fell to communism, its neighbors would inevitably topple next, like a row of dominoes.[^27]

By 1961, the Cold War was at its peak. The Iron Curtain had divided Europe, and the U.S. was already reeling from the loss of China to communism in 1949 and a bloody stalemate in the Korean War. When John F. Kennedy took office in January 1961, he inherited a world where the "Red Threat" was no longer a distant problem in Eurasia. It was now a domestic security issue. The fear was that a successful communist Cuba would export revolution to the rest of Latin America, threatening the Panama Canal and the very stability of the Western Hemisphere.[^21]

### The Space Race

While the struggle for land was intense, the struggle for technology was even more so. In the late 1950s, the Soviet Union shocked the world by launching **Sputnik**, the first artificial satellite, into orbit. This wasn't just a scientific achievement—it was a terrifying display of military potential. If the Soviets could launch a satellite into space, they could also launch a nuclear warhead across oceans. This led to widespread American fear of a **Missile Gap**: the belief that the USSR had surpassed the United States in nuclear capability.[^16]

During his 1960 campaign, John F. Kennedy used this fear to criticize the previous administration for being soft on defense. Although intelligence eventually showed that the U.S. actually had more missiles than the Soviets, the perception of being behind drove the U.S. to pour massive amounts of money into NASA and the military. This competition created a high-pressure environment where any Soviet move—like placing missiles in Cuba—was seen not just as a tactical shift, but as a challenge to American global leadership and technological superiority.[^18]

### The Bay of Pigs

In an attempt to remove the Cuban threat without starting a direct world war, the CIA developed a plan during the Eisenhower years that Kennedy ultimately approved. Known as the **Bay of Pigs Invasion**, the mission involved training a force of approximately 1,400 Cuban exiles (known as Brigade 2506) to invade the island and spark a popular uprising against Castro.[^36]

The invasion, which took place in April 1961, was a catastrophe. The plan relied on **plausible deniability**—the idea that the U.S. could claim it wasn't involved. But the landing site at Playa Girón was a swampy mess, and the Cuban military was far more prepared than the CIA had anticipated. When the invasion began to fail, Kennedy—fearing that full-scale American intervention would lead to Soviet retaliation in Berlin—refused to provide the promised U.S. air cover. Within 72 hours, the exiles were killed or captured.[^19]

The fallout was immense. For Kennedy, it was a humiliating public defeat that made him look weak and indecisive on the world stage. For Castro, it was a massive propaganda victory that solidified his control over Cuba. Most critically, the Bay of Pigs convinced Castro and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev that the U.S. was absolutely determined to invade Cuba again. This fear led Castro to seek even deeper military ties with the Soviets, eventually requesting the defensive weapons that would trigger the 1962 crisis.[^16]

### Operation Mongoose

Following the failure at the Bay of Pigs, the Kennedy administration didn't stop trying to remove Castro. Instead, they went underground. In late 1961, the President authorized **Operation Mongoose**, a top-secret program led by Robert Kennedy and the CIA designed to use all available means to overthrow the Cuban government. This wasn't a traditional war; it was a campaign of sabotage, propaganda, and psychological warfare.[^4]

The CIA engaged in bizarre and often dangerous plots. They sabotaged Cuban sugar harvests, blew up factories, and even attempted to assassinate Castro using everything from poisonous cigars to exploding seashells. While many of these plans were unsuccessful, they sent a clear message to Havana and Moscow: the United States was not going to let Cuba remain communist.

For Khrushchev and Castro, Operation Mongoose was proof that a second, much larger U.S. invasion was inevitable. This belief was the primary defensive justification for the Soviet decision to send nuclear missiles to the island—they believed that only the threat of nuclear war would stop the Americans from finally finishing what they started at the Bay of Pigs.[^32]

### The Arms Race and Mutually Assured Destruction

As the 1960s began, the Cold War had evolved into a terrifying **Arms Race**. Both the U.S. and the USSR were stockpiling thousands of nuclear warheads, many of which were hundreds of times more powerful than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This created a strategic doctrine known as **Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)**. The logic was simple: if both sides had enough nuclear weapons to survive a first strike and retaliate, then starting a war would be suicide.[^5]

The balance of MAD, however, was not equal. In 1962, the U.S. held a massive lead in **Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs)** that could reach the USSR from American soil. The U.S. had also placed **Jupiter Missiles** in Turkey and Italy, right on the Soviet border, which could hit Moscow in under 15 minutes. Khrushchev felt surrounded and vulnerable. He believed that by placing medium-range missiles in Cuba, he could even the playing field. It wasn't just about protecting Castro—it was about achieving **Nuclear Parity** and forcing the U.S. to feel the same sense of immediate, 15-minute threat that the Soviets felt every day.[^15]

When U-2 spy planes finally photographed the construction of Soviet missile sites in Cuba in October 1962, the world was forced to confront the reality that the theory of MAD was about to be put to its ultimate, literal test. The Thirteenth Day had begun.

## Statement of the Problem

### The Morning of October 16th

The crisis officially began at 9:00 AM on October 16, 1962. National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy entered President Kennedy's bedroom to deliver a briefing that would change the course of history. U-2 spy plane photographs from two days prior had been analyzed by the National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC). The evidence was undeniable: the Soviet Union was actively constructing Medium-Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) sites in the Cuban countryside.[^10]

These were not just defensive anti-aircraft missiles. These were **SS-4 Sandal missiles**, capable of carrying a one-megaton nuclear warhead over a distance of 1,000 nautical miles. From their positions in Cuba, they could strike Washington D.C., New York City, or Dallas in less than 15 minutes. For the first time in American history, the mainland United States was directly under the nuclear gun of a foreign power.[^11]

### The Existence of EXCOMM

Faced with this unprecedented threat, President Kennedy immediately convened a group of twelve high-ranking advisors, which became known as the **Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM)**. This is the body you represent. You are tasked with a burden heavier than any council in human history: how to remove the missiles without triggering a nuclear holocaust that could end civilization.[^31]

The problem you face is not just military; it is a problem of uncertainty. You do not know if the warheads are already in Cuba. You do not know if the Soviet commanders on the ground have the authority to fire them. Most importantly, you do not know how Nikita Khrushchev will react to any American move. A single miscalculation—a ship fired upon, a plane shot down, or a message misinterpreted—could lead to a spasm war that neither side actually wants.[^24]

### Hawks vs. Doves

As you begin your deliberations, the committee is sharply divided between two schools of thought.

On one side are the **Hawks**, primarily led by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (initially). They argue that the only way to ensure American safety is through swift, decisive military action.[^33] They advocate for a massive **Surgical Air Strike** to destroy the missile sites before they become operational, likely followed by a full-scale invasion of Cuba to remove Fidel Castro once and for all.

On the other side are the **Doves**, including UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson and, at times, Attorney General Robert Kennedy. They warn that an unannounced attack on a small nation like Cuba would destroy America's moral standing in the world and would almost certainly provoke a Soviet counter-attack against West Berlin or even a nuclear strike on the U.S.[^22] They prefer a path of diplomacy, negotiation, and perhaps a trade involving American missiles in Europe.

You must navigate these conflicting perspectives. If you choose the military path, you risk World War III. If you choose the diplomatic path, you risk appearing weak and allowing the Soviet Union to solidify a nuclear base in your own backyard.[^16]

### The Quarantine and the Law of the Sea

One of the most immediate problems you must solve is the arrival of more Soviet equipment. Dozens of Soviet ships are currently steaming toward Cuba, some of them likely carrying more missiles and nuclear components.

To stop them, the President has considered a naval blockade. However, under international law, a blockade is considered an act of war. To avoid this legal trap, the administration has proposed a **Quarantine**—a more limited naval barrier that only stops offensive weapons.[^13] But even this is fraught with danger. If a U.S. Navy ship stops a Soviet vessel on the high seas and the Soviets refuse to turn back, who fires the first shot? Does a skirmish at sea automatically mean the end of the world?

You must decide the **Rules of Engagement** for American sailors who are standing toe-to-toe with Soviet captains in the middle of the Atlantic.[^6]

### The Domestic Front

While you debate in secret, the American public remains largely unaware of the danger. However, you must consider the **Home Front**. If word leaks that nuclear missiles are 90 miles away, how will the public react? Will there be mass riots? Will people flee the cities, clogging the highways and making a military mobilization impossible?[^35]

Furthermore, there is the political reality of the **1962 Midterm Elections**. If the President appears to let the Soviets push him around, his party will suffer a crushing defeat, and his ability to govern will be destroyed. You must manage the flow of information to the press and decide when—and how—to tell the American people that they are living on the brink of destruction.[^25]

### Global Entanglements

Finally, you cannot look at Cuba in isolation. The Soviet Union has long coveted **West Berlin**, an island of democracy deep inside communist East Germany. Khrushchev has repeatedly threatened to squeeze Berlin to force the U.S. out of Europe.[^18]

There is a very real fear that any action taken in Cuba will be met with a Soviet takeover of Berlin. If that happens, the U.S. is treaty-bound by NATO to go to war to defend Germany. Your problem is global: how do you defend the Western Hemisphere without sacrificing our allies in Europe? How do you maintain the unity of the NATO alliance when our partners are terrified that an American mistake in the Caribbean will lead to their destruction in a nuclear crossfire?

The clock is ticking. The missile sites in Cuba are being finished as you read this. Every hour that passes brings the Sandal missiles closer to being operational. You must act, but you must act with a precision that the world has never seen before.[^21]

## Portfolio Powers

### Robert F. Kennedy (Attorney General)

As the President's brother and most trusted advisor, Robert Kennedy acts as the informal lead of EXCOMM. His unique position allows him to transcend traditional cabinet boundaries, acting as the President's eyes and ears across all departments.

**Unique Power - Inquiry Directives:** RFK can force any other delegate to reveal the status of their private crisis notes or intelligence.

**Primary Goal:** Find a middle way—specifically the Naval Quarantine—that avoids the "Pearl Harbor in reverse" of a surprise air strike while maintaining American prestige. He is also tasked with managing back-channel communications with the Soviet embassy.

Delegates playing RFK must balance their loyalty to the President's legacy with the pragmatic need to avoid nuclear war at any cost.[^8]

### Robert McNamara (Secretary of Defense)

Robert McNamara is the architect of the **Flexible Response** doctrine. Known for his "Whiz Kid" statistical approach to war, he views the crisis as a problem of management and logic.

**Unique Power - Logistical Oversight:** McNamara can determine the success rate of any military-themed directive based on its resource efficiency.

**Primary Goal:** Ensure that any military response is perfectly calibrated. He famously argued that "a missile is not just a missile but a political signal."

In committee, he should focus on the technical details of the Quarantine and the readiness of the U.S. nuclear triad. His challenge is to prevent the Joint Chiefs from escalating to a full invasion before diplomacy has been exhausted.[^31]

### Dean Rusk (Secretary of State)

The soft-spoken Dean Rusk represents the traditional diplomatic establishment. While he is often overshadowed by more aggressive members of EXCOMM, his power lies in **International Legitimacy**.

**Unique Power:** Rusk is the only delegate who can officially mobilize the Organization of American States (OAS) or NATO to issue joint declarations.

**Primary Goal:** Ensure that the U.S. does not act unilaterally, which would alienate allies and potentially trigger a Soviet move on Berlin.[^3] He is deeply concerned about the legal ramifications of the blockade and seeks to frame the U.S. position as a defense of the Western Hemisphere's integrity.

Rusk should focus on drafting the legal justifications for the Quarantine and maintaining the united front of the West.

### McGeorge Bundy (National Security Advisor)

McGeorge Bundy is the gatekeeper of information for the President. Having been the first to brief JFK on the missiles, he possesses the **Priority Briefing** power.

**Unique Power - Priority Briefing:** Bundy can see any Crisis Breaks five minutes before the rest of the committee.

**Primary Goal:** Present the President with a clear, vetted range of options rather than a chaotic debate. He is known for playing devil's advocate, often switching sides between the Hawks and Doves to test the strength of their arguments.[^21]

In committee, Bundy should focus on synthesizing the various proposals into a single National Security Action Memorandum. His unique challenge is managing the flow of intelligence from the CIA and NPIC to ensure no advisor is left in the dark.

### Adlai Stevenson (UN Ambassador)

Adlai Stevenson is the leading Dove of the committee and the voice of the international community.

**Unique Power - Security Council Motion:** Stevenson can bring the crisis before the UN to stall for time or gain global sympathy.

**Primary Goal:** A negotiated settlement, even if it requires unthinkable concessions like trading U.S. Jupiter missiles in Turkey for Soviet missiles in Cuba. He is often at odds with the Hawks who see him as soft.[^32]

In committee, Stevenson should focus on the public relations battle, preparing for a showdown at the UN where he can present photographic evidence to the world. His challenge is to keep the path to peace open even as the military prepares for war.

### General Maxwell Taylor (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs)

General Maxwell Taylor represents the unified voice of the U.S. military. Unlike the more bellicose LeMay, Taylor is a proponent of Flexible Response, but he remains convinced that only a military solution can truly remove the missiles.

**Unique Power - Operational Command:** Taylor has the final say on the tactical placement of troops and aircraft in private notes.

**Primary Goal:** Prepare the military for an **Oplan 312** (air strike) and **Oplan 316** (invasion).

In committee, he must ensure that the civilian advisors understand the risks of doing nothing.[^31] Taylor should focus on the readiness of the 82nd Airborne and the logistical hurdles of a landing on Cuban soil.

### John McCone (Director of Central Intelligence)

John McCone is the only Republican in the inner circle and the man who originally suspected the Soviet build-up.

**Unique Power - Intelligence Extraction:** McCone can verify the truthfulness of one Crisis Break per session or gain additional details on Soviet troop movements.

**Primary Goal:** Provide the ground truth that cuts through political rhetoric.[^20] He is particularly concerned about the SAM sites protecting the missiles and the potential for Soviet denial and deception.

In committee, McCone should focus on the technical capabilities of the SS-4 missiles and the timeline for when they become operational. His challenge is maintaining the CIA's relevance after the failure of the Bay of Pigs.

### Lyndon B. Johnson (Vice President)

Lyndon B. Johnson occupies a difficult position: he is the heart of the Democratic party but often feels excluded from the President's inner "Camelot" circle.

**Unique Power - Congressional Whip:** LBJ can guarantee the passage of any domestic funding or authorization directive by leaning on his old Senate allies.

**Primary Goal:** Ensure that the administration does not appear weak to the American public or the GOP. He is a political hawk, fearing that a failure in Cuba will lead to a Republican landslide in the upcoming midterms.

In committee, LBJ should focus on the domestic political fallout and ensure that the President has the political cover necessary to take high-stakes risks.[^2]

### Ted Sorensen (Special Counsel to the President)

Ted Sorensen is the President's alter ego and primary speechwriter.

**Unique Power - The Bully Pulpit:** Sorensen can draft the official Presidential Addresses that the chair will read to the public, influencing the Global Panic level.

**Primary Goal:** Craft a narrative that justifies American actions as a defense of freedom and peace, rather than an act of aggression. He is a staunch ally of Robert Kennedy and shares his Dovish leanings, searching for a legal and moral framework for the Quarantine.

In committee, Sorensen should focus on the language of directives and the public-facing messaging of EXCOMM. His challenge is to find words that project strength without backing Khrushchev into a corner.[^10]

### General Curtis LeMay (Air Force Chief of Staff)

General Curtis LeMay is the quintessential Hawk. A veteran of the firebombing of Japan, he believes that the only way to deal with communists is through overwhelming force.

**Unique Power - Strategic Alert:** LeMay can move the U.S. to DEFCON 2 unilaterally once per committee, drastically increasing the military's power but spiking the Nuclear Tension meter.

**Primary Goal:** A total air strike followed by an invasion. He famously called the Quarantine "almost as bad as the appeasement at Munich."

In committee, LeMay should advocate for the immediate destruction of the missile sites and the removal of Castro. His challenge is to convince the civilian advisors that the Soviets will not retaliate if the U.S. strikes first.[^11]

### Douglas Dillon (Secretary of the Treasury)

Douglas Dillon is a Republican and a financial expert who views the crisis through the lens of global stability and the Gold Standard.

**Unique Power - Economic Sanctions:** Dillon can freeze the assets of any nation or entity that supports the Soviet build-up.

**Primary Goal:** Protect the U.S. dollar and prevent a global economic collapse triggered by a war scare. He is surprisingly Hawkish, believing that a decisive show of force is better for the markets than a prolonged, uncertain standoff.

In committee, Dillon should focus on the cost of mobilization and the potential for a Blockade to disrupt global trade. His challenge is to find the funds for a war that the U.S. cannot afford to lose.[^37]

### Arthur Lundahl (Director of NPIC)

Arthur Lundahl is the man who read the photos that started the crisis. He is a technical expert rather than a politician.

**Unique Power - Photo Interpretation:** Lundahl can request a Close-Up Analysis of any map or image provided in a crisis break, revealing hidden details like missile readiness or camouflaged sites.[^37]

**Primary Goal:** Ensure that EXCOMM's decisions are based on hard evidence, not speculation. He is the committee's anchor to reality.

In committee, Lundahl should focus on the timeline of the Soviet construction and the technical limitations of the U-2 flights. His challenge is communicating complex technical data to non-expert politicians who are under extreme emotional stress.[^19]

### Admiral George Anderson (Chief of Naval Operations)

Admiral George Anderson is the man responsible for executing the Naval Quarantine. He is a traditionalist who views the Navy as a professional tool that should be managed by sailors, not "Whiz Kid" civilians like McNamara.

**Unique Power - Naval Interdiction:** Anderson can choose which Soviet ships to stop and search in his private notes.

**Primary Goal:** Maintain the sanctity of the sea and ensure the safety of his fleet. He is often at odds with McNamara over the specific Rules of Engagement.

In committee, Anderson should focus on the logistics of the blockade line and the physical presence of Soviet submarines in the Atlantic. His challenge is preventing a rogue encounter from escalating into a full naval war.[^17]

### John Scali (ABC News Correspondent)

John Scali represents the Fourth Estate but plays a much more dangerous game. Historically, Scali acted as a back-channel intermediary between the U.S. and Soviet intelligence (the Fomin-Scali talks).

**Unique Power - The Leak:** Scali can publish one Anonymous Story per session that influences public opinion or triggers a reaction from the Soviets.

**Primary Goal:** Facilitate a secret deal while maintaining his professional integrity.

In committee, Scali should use his contacts to test the waters for potential trades or compromises.[^13] He is the only delegate who can communicate off-the-record with the back-room's Soviet characters. His challenge is staying relevant in a room full of generals and cabinet members.

### Edward R. Murrow (Director of the USIA)

Edward R. Murrow is the master of **Public Diplomacy** and propaganda. Having transitioned from a legendary journalist to a government official, he manages the Voice of America.

**Unique Power - Global Broadcast:** Murrow can target specific countries (like Cuba or the USSR) with radio messages to lower their morale or encourage dissent.

**Primary Goal:** Win the war of ideas and ensure that the world sees the U.S. as the defender of peace. He is deeply concerned about the moral cost of the crisis.[^24]

In committee, Murrow should focus on the psychological warfare aspect of the Quarantine and the messaging sent to the Cuban people. His challenge is maintaining credibility in a world where the truth is often a military secret.

### Jerome Wiesner (Science Advisor to the President)

Jerome Wiesner is the voice of the scientific community and a personal friend of JFK.

**Unique Power - Technical Assessment:** Wiesner can debunk or confirm the Nuclear Yield or Probability of Success of any proposed weapon or strategy.

**Primary Goal:** Prevent a nuclear accident and ensure that the President understands the apocalyptic reality of Nuclear Winter. He is a strong advocate for arms control and is terrified of the accidental start of a war.

In committee, Wiesner should focus on the technical aspects of the Soviet missiles and the potential for radar errors. His challenge is being the voice of doom in a room full of people who want action.[^7]

### Walter Cronkite (CBS News Anchor)

While not an official member of EXCOMM, Walter Cronkite represents the American Public and the power of the evening news.

**Unique Power - National Sentiment:** Cronkite's reporting can raise or lower the Panic Level of the American people, affecting the success of LBJ's domestic directives.

**Primary Goal:** Find the truth and provide a calm, steady hand to a terrified nation.

In committee, he should use his private notes to interview other delegates and gather information. If the committee lies to Cronkite and he finds out, the Trust in Government meter will plummet. His challenge is balancing his duty to the truth with the patriotic need to prevent a mass exodus from the cities.[^5]

### Steuart Pittman (Assistant Secretary of Defense for Civil Defense)

Steuart Pittman is the man in charge of "Duck and Cover."

**Unique Power - Civil Preparedness:** Pittman can establish Fallout Shelters and Evacuation Zones in major cities via private notes.

**Primary Goal:** Save as many lives as possible in the event of a nuclear strike. He is the most pessimistic member of the committee, as his very existence assumes that war is possible.

In committee, Pittman should focus on the logistics of survival, requesting funds for food stockpiles and radiation kits. His challenge is preventing the public from realizing that his shelters are largely symbolic and would not survive a direct nuclear hit.[^1]

### James B. Donovan (Attorney and Negotiator)

James Donovan is a master negotiator who recently traded Soviet spy Rudolf Abel for U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. He is currently negotiating the release of the Bay of Pigs prisoners with Fidel Castro.

**Unique Power - Direct Channel:** Donovan can send private notes directly to Fidel Castro (the back room) without the State Department's approval.

**Primary Goal:** Use the prisoner negotiations as a front for larger diplomatic talks.

In committee, Donovan should focus on **The Castro Variable**, attempting to drive a wedge between the Cuban leader and his Soviet patrons. His challenge is convincing the Hawks that talking to a communist dictator is not a sign of weakness.[^10]

### A. Philip Randolph (Civil Rights Leader)

A. Philip Randolph represents the moral conscience of the United States and the specific concerns of the African American community.

**Unique Power - The Grassroots Mandate:** Randolph can threaten a March on Washington or a labor strike if the administration's war plans ignore the needs of the poor and marginalized.

**Primary Goal:** Ensure that a "White Man's War" does not destroy the progress of the Civil Rights movement. He is concerned that a war will lead to martial law and the suspension of civil liberties.

In committee, Randolph should focus on the domestic impact of a war economy and the protection of civil rights during the crisis. His challenge is making the committee care about social justice when the world is ending.[^30]
