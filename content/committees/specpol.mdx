Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to SPECPOL at JAMUN! This committee promises to be an engaging and rewarding experience as we tackle the critical intersection of international trade and the economic security of colonized nations.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,

Joshua Varon

Founder, JAMUN
