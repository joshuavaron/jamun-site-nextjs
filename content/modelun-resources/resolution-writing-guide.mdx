## Writing a UN Resolution

Resolutions are the primary output of Model UN committees. They represent the committee's official position and proposed actions on an issue.

### Resolution Structure

A resolution consists of three parts:

#### 1. Header
- Committee name
- Topic
- Sponsors (countries who wrote it)
- Signatories (countries who support bringing it to vote)

#### 2. Preambulatory Clauses
These set the context for the resolution. They:
- Reference past UN actions
- State relevant facts
- Acknowledge the problem

**Common preambulatory phrases:**
- *Recognizing...*
- *Noting with concern...*
- *Bearing in mind...*
- *Reaffirming...*
- *Deeply concerned...*

#### 3. Operative Clauses
These are the action items. They specify what the committee wants to happen.

**Common operative phrases:**
- *Calls upon...*
- *Encourages...*
- *Requests...*
- *Urges...*
- *Decides...*

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Vague language weakens resolutions
2. **Be realistic**: Propose achievable actions
3. **Build coalitions**: Work with other countries
4. **Number clauses**: Use standard formatting
5. **Review for errors**: Spelling and grammar matter
