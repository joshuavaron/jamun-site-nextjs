## Letter from the Chair

Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to SOCHUM at JAMUN! This committee promises to be an engaging and rewarding experience as we address the pressing humanitarian issues of homelessness and refugee displacement in Europe.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,

Joshua Varon

Founder, JAMUN

## Structure and Mechanics

**The Great Depression: America at the Brink, 1932** is a continuous crisis committee. Most Model UN committees focus on international diplomacy. This one drops you into the heart of a domestic American catastrophe. You'll play a leader, economist, or activist on an emergency council charged with one mission: save the nation from total economic and social collapse.

The committee runs on a **Continuous Crisis** model, meaning debate never ends with a single resolution. Instead, two rooms work in constant tension: the **Front Room** (the committee floor) and the **Back Room** (the crisis staff).

In the Front Room, you'll debate policy through moderated and unmoderated caucuses: banking regulations, direct relief for the unemployed, emergency powers. When you reach decisions, you'll pass **Directives**: short, actionable orders from your council to the outside world. Think: *"Deploy the National Guard to protect food shipments"* or *"Establish a temporary currency in Chicago."*

The Back Room is where the world pushes back. You influence it through **Crisis Notes**, private letters written in character to people you trust: loyal employees, political allies, family members. A wealthy industrialist might instruct his factory foreman to stockpile coal. A labor leader might secretly order a sit-down strike. Here's the key: your private goals don't have to match what you say in public.

Each **Crisis Cycle** starts with a **Crisis Break**: a news bulletin, a telegram, maybe a live guest bursting in with urgent developments. A major bank has failed. A riot has broken out in a Hooverville. You debate, you write directives, you vote. Once a directive passes, the crisis staff decides what happens next. Then the cycle begins again.

One more thing: this is 1932. No computers. No cell phones. Your crisis notes represent letters sent by post, telegrams tapped out in Morse code, whispered conversations in hallways. Information moves at the speed of a train or a radio broadcast. To succeed, you'll need to think like a 1930s leader, working with the tools and limitations of the era to steer a desperate nation through its darkest hour.

## History of the Problem

### The Roaring Twenties and the Illusion of Wealth

To understand how America reached this breaking point, look back at the decade before.

The 1920s, the **Roaring Twenties**, seemed like an era of endless prosperity. After World War I, the United States emerged as the world's leading industrial power. Automobiles, radios, and refrigerators filled American homes, all powered by a seductive new idea: **consumer credit**. Buy now, pay later. For the first time, ordinary people could live beyond their means. And millions did.[^3]

The stock market became a national obsession. Not just bankers, but teachers, shopkeepers, and factory workers poured their savings into stocks. Many bought **on margin**, paying only a fraction of a stock's price upfront and borrowing the rest. The assumption? Prices would keep climbing forever. As skyscrapers rose over Manhattan, the nation's wealth rested on a foundation of debt and blind optimism.[^6]

Cracks were already spreading beneath the surface. While cities boomed, rural America was quietly collapsing. After the war, European farms recovered, and demand for American crops vanished. Prices cratered. Farmers who had borrowed to expand couldn't repay their loans. By the mid-1920s, hundreds of rural banks had already failed, an early warning that the rest of the country chose to ignore.[^7]

### The Crash of 1929

The illusion shattered in October 1929.

After weeks of instability, the stock market went into freefall. On **Black Tuesday**, October 29, it collapsed completely. Billions of dollars in wealth evaporated in a single afternoon. Investors who had bought on margin were wiped out. Panic spread from Wall Street to Main Street as Americans watched their life savings disappear.[^10]

The crash alone didn't cause the Great Depression, but it lit the fuse. It shattered public confidence and triggered a **liquidity crisis**. Terrified consumers stopped spending. Businesses slashed production. Layoffs cascaded through the economy, and each wave of job losses meant less money circulating, which meant more layoffs. A vicious spiral had begun.

The psychological damage cut just as deep. For millions, the crash felt like the death of the American Dream. Suicide rates climbed. The giddy optimism of the 1920s gave way to cold, numbing fear. And the government? It had no plan. No tools. No idea what to do next.[^15]

### The Banking Collapse and the Run on Gold

As the economy contracted, the banking system began to disintegrate.

In the 1930s, there was no federal deposit insurance. If your bank ran out of cash, it simply locked its doors, and you lost everything. Once that fear took hold, it became self-fulfilling. Panicked depositors rushed to withdraw their money before it vanished. These **bank runs** overwhelmed even healthy institutions, triggering a chain reaction of failures.[^19]

By 1932, more than 5,000 banks had collapsed. Families lost their life savings overnight. Businesses couldn't get loans to make payroll. In some regions, the cash economy simply stopped functioning. People resorted to barter (trading eggs for shoes, firewood for haircuts) because dollars had become impossibly scarce.[^12]

President Hoover and the Federal Reserve held firm, convinced the economy would heal itself. They also feared abandoning the **Gold Standard**, which required the government to hold enough gold to back every dollar in circulation. As panicked citizens hoarded gold, the Fed raised interest rates to protect the currency, a move that made borrowing even harder and accidentally deepened the Depression.[^4]

### The Dust Bowl

While cities reeled from unemployment, the Great Plains faced an apocalypse of a different kind.

Decades of aggressive farming had stripped away the prairie grasses that anchored the soil. When a brutal drought struck in the early 1930s, the earth itself began to blow away. Massive **black blizzards**, walls of dust hundreds of feet high, rolled across the plains, burying farms, killing livestock, and suffocating anyone caught outside.[^1]

Hundreds of thousands of families abandoned their land. These refugees (mockingly called **"Okies"** and **"Arkies"**) loaded their belongings onto broken-down trucks and headed for California, chasing rumors of work in the orchards. What they found instead was a state overwhelmed by desperate migrants, and communities that greeted them with hostility, even violence.[^15]

The crisis went beyond economics. It was a rupture in the relationship between Americans and the land itself. The federal government had no framework for dealing with environmental refugees. Thousands of families ended up stranded in roadside camps, with nothing to do and nowhere to go.[^17]

### The Failure of Voluntaryism

Herbert Hoover wasn't heartless. His philosophy, however, failed catastrophically.

Hoover believed in **Voluntaryism**: the idea that private charity and business goodwill, not government handouts, should carry people through hard times.[^36] Direct relief, he argued, would destroy Americans' character and work ethic. So instead of federal aid, he urged businesses to maintain wages voluntarily and asked organizations like the Red Cross to feed the hungry.[^32]

It wasn't nearly enough. Charities ran dry within months. In major cities, the only thing standing between families and starvation was a breadline stretching around the block. Donations evaporated as the wealthy lost their own fortunes. By 1931, it was obvious: the crisis had grown far too large for churches and city governments to handle alone.[^39]

Hoover eventually created the **Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)** to lend money to major banks and railroads, hoping prosperity would "trickle down" to workers. To ordinary Americans, it looked like a cruel joke—the President would bail out bankers, but not families losing their homes. Across the country, homeless encampments sprang up in city parks: shantytowns of cardboard and scrap metal that people bitterly named **Hoovervilles**.[^37]

### The Threat of Revolution

By the summer of 1932, America was ready to explode.

Thousands of World War I veterans descended on Washington, D.C., calling themselves the **Bonus Expeditionary Force**. They demanded early payment of service bonuses Congress had promised them. They set up a sprawling camp on the Anacostia Flats (men, women, and children) and refused to leave until they got what they were owed.[^35]

The government's response was a catastrophe. Fearing communist infiltration, Hoover ordered the Army to clear the camps. General Douglas MacArthur rolled in with tanks, tear gas, and bayonets. Soldiers drove out the veterans and torched their shelters. The spectacle of the U.S. military attacking its own war heroes shocked the nation and convinced millions that their government had lost all moral authority.[^42]

The Bonus Army wasn't an isolated incident. Across the Midwest, farmers armed with pitchforks blocked sheriffs from foreclosing on their neighbors. In cities, communist and fascist organizations swelled with new recruits. The country wasn't just poor anymore. It was furious. Revolution, once unthinkable, now felt like a genuine possibility.[^31]

## Statement of the Problem

### The Immediate Collapse of Capital

The American economy is in freefall.

The great Bull Market of the 1920s has become a slaughterhouse. Stock prices are plunging so fast that the ticker tape machines can't keep up—investors don't even know how much they've lost. But the real crisis isn't paper wealth. It's **liquidity**. Banks have called in their margin loans. Borrowers have no cash to repay them. The entire financial infrastructure of the United States is teetering. If the biggest investment houses go down, they'll drag the commercial banks with them—and wipe out the savings of every family in America.

Without immediate intervention, the banking system will freeze completely. If people can't withdraw money to buy bread or pay rent, the cities will descend into chaos. Your choices are stark: shut down the stock exchanges to stop the bleeding, organize massive **Banker's Pools** to bail out failing firms, or let the market crash to its natural bottom, whatever the human cost. Every hour of government silence feeds the panic spreading through the streets.[^13][^17]

Here's what makes this so dangerous: fear is contagious. For years, Americans were told prosperity would last forever. Now they're watching their savings vanish, and trust is collapsing into terror. If everyone rushes to pull their money out tomorrow, the banks won't have enough cash to pay them. Your first job is to restore confidence before the bank runs become an epidemic no amount of gold can cure.[^16][^24]

### Unemployment and Starvation

The crash has triggered mass layoffs, and they're accelerating.

Factories stuffed with unsold goods are slashing their workforces to survive. Luxury spending has evaporated. And unlike most European nations, the United States has no unemployment insurance, no federal welfare system, no safety net at all. When a man loses his job, he loses his next meal. His family is one missed rent payment from living on the street.[^13]

The scale of the suffering is unprecedented. Local charities and churches are reporting that their funds are gone—they were never built to handle anything like this. If the federal government can't find a way to provide direct relief or create public jobs, you're looking at mass starvation in the richest country on earth. Here's what terrifies the people in power: hungry people don't stay peaceful. That anger will eventually find a target—and it might be the very system you're trying to save.[^21]

This is a race against time. When people lose hope, they stop following rules. You're already seeing hunger marches, protests, the first sparks of unrest. If you can't put food on the table, Americans will look for someone who can, even if that someone is promising a very different kind of country.

### The Rural Emergency and Agricultural Debt

The cities are burning, but the countryside has been smoldering for years.

Farmers were already drowning before the crash. Overproduction had driven prices into the ground, and now the credit freeze has cut off their lifeline. They can't borrow for seeds. They can't pay the interest on their mortgages. Foreclosures are sweeping through the Midwest and South. Families who've worked the same land for generations are getting eviction notices from banks that are themselves desperate for cash.[^19]

This isn't just a financial problem. It's an existential threat. If farmers lose their land, who grows the food? You're facing a nightmare scenario: city dwellers who can't afford to eat, and rural producers who can't afford to plant. Balancing those needs will be one of your hardest challenges, especially as farm leaders start talking about withholding food from the cities until someone cancels their debts.[^15]

Hovering over all of it: environmental catastrophe. Years of reckless farming have left the soil exhausted and exposed. If a serious drought hits now, on top of everything else, millions could be displaced. You have to decide whether the federal government should intervene in the land market to save American agriculture, or stand back and let economic "natural law" take its course, even if it kills the rural way of life.[^27]

### The Fragility of the International Order

The crisis doesn't stop at the border.

American loans have been propping up the post-war global economy. Under the **Dawes and Young Plans**, U.S. banks lend money to Germany, which uses it to pay war reparations to Britain and France, who use that money to repay their debts to America. It's an elaborate financial loop, and if American capital dries up, the whole thing collapses. The global economy shatters.[^36]

The political consequences could be catastrophic. Extremist parties are already rising in Germany and Italy, blaming the international capitalist system for their countries' suffering. If the United States turns inward (raising tariffs, cutting off loans, retreating into isolation), it might save American banks in the short term. It could also trigger a wave of nationalism and militarism that leads straight to another world war.

You have to choose: protect America first, or try to hold the international order together? In an age of rising **isolationism**, the wrong decision could leave the United States alone in a world on fire.

### The Crisis of Faith

The deepest wound may be invisible: Americans are losing faith in the system itself.

People are asking hard questions. Can capitalism actually solve a crisis this big? Can democracy move fast enough to save us? Radical movements on both the left and the right are growing at alarming speed. If the leaders in this room can't deliver answers, the American people may turn to someone who promises simpler solutions: a strongman, a revolutionary party, a regime that doesn't bother with elections.

The survival of the United States as a constitutional republic is no longer guaranteed. It's on the table, right now, waiting for you to decide what happens next.[^43]

## Delegate Positions

### Thomas W. Lamont – Senior Partner, J.P. Morgan & Co.

Lamont is Wall Street's unofficial leader—the man other bankers look to in a crisis. His unique power is organizing **Banker's Pools**: private funds that buy up stocks to stabilize the market artificially. In committee, he decides which firms get credit and which get left to die. His goal is to preserve the gold standard and keep the government's hands off the financial sector. Through his crisis notes, he can coordinate with central banks in London and Paris to manage the international fallout.[^40]

### Albert H. Wiggin – Chairman, Chase National Bank

Wiggin is a predator. He's famous for short-selling his own bank's stock to profit from the crash while his depositors lost everything. He knows the market's mechanics better than almost anyone, and he has deep personal wealth to deploy. In committee, he can manipulate stock prices and crush weaker competitors. His goal is to maximize his own liquidity while preventing a total bank run that would destroy him too. His notes let him move capital to safety or fund investigations into rivals.[^24]

### Gerard Swope – President, General Electric

Swope is a different kind of capitalist: a corporate progressive who believes big business must build its own safety nets before the socialists do it for them. He can set industry-wide standards for wages and hours. In committee, he offers **The Swope Plan**—a proposal for business-led social insurance designed to head off more radical government intervention. His goal is to keep workers loyal to capitalism. His notes let him coordinate with other industrial titans—Ford, US Steel—to form cartels that dominate the American market.[^20]

### Andrew Mellon – Secretary of the Treasury

Mellon is a billionaire, the architect of 1920s tax policy, and an ideological purist. His famous prescription for the Depression: *"Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate."* Let the rot burn out. In committee, he controls the federal budget and advises the President on fiscal policy. His goal is a balanced budget at all costs—he believes debt will destroy the dollar. His notes give him influence over the Federal Reserve and the power to block spending bills he considers wasteful.[^10]

### Eugene Meyer – Chairman, Federal Reserve

Meyer controls America's money supply. He sets interest rates. He decides which failing banks get emergency lifelines and which are allowed to die. In committee, he can expand or contract the amount of currency in circulation—a decision that ripples through every corner of the economy. His goal is to protect the dollar's value and guard the nation's gold reserves from speculators. His notes let him monitor bank health across all twelve Federal Reserve districts and order audits of suspicious institutions.[^14]

### Frances Perkins – New York State Industrial Commissioner

Perkins is a sociologist, a labor advocate, and one of the few people in the room arguing that the government should help ordinary people directly, not just bail out corporations. She can mobilize New York's labor department to track unemployment and enforce workplace safety laws. In committee, she makes the case for a **New Deal**: social insurance, public works, a minimum wage. Her notes let her organize social workers and activists to apply pressure from outside the room.[^15]

### John L. Lewis – President, United Mine Workers

Lewis speaks for the coal miners, the men who power American industry. He has one devastating weapon: the ability to call a general strike that shuts down the nation's energy supply. In committee, he's the voice of the angry worker, threatening unrest if the bankers get bailed out while laborers starve. His goal is collective bargaining rights and living wages for all industrial workers. His notes let him coordinate strike actions and build alliances with other major unions.[^18]

### Mary McLeod Bethune – President, National Council of Negro Women

Bethune is an educator, an organizer, and a civil rights leader. She represents the Black Americans being hit hardest by the collapse—last hired, first fired, and often excluded from relief programs entirely. She can mobilize Black voters and community networks nationwide. In committee, she demands that any relief be distributed fairly, regardless of race. Her goals: federal anti-lynching legislation and equal access to government jobs. Her notes let her coordinate with the NAACP and the informal "Black Cabinet" to expose discrimination.[^30]

### Milo Reno – President, Farmers' Holiday Association

Reno is a radical agrarian who's done asking politely. His position is simple: if farmers can't get fair prices, they'll stop food from reaching the cities. He can organize **Farm Holidays**—strikes—and physical blockades of highways to halt milk and grain shipments. In committee, he threatens a national food shortage to force debt relief.[^23] His goal is a **Cost of Production** guarantee for all farm goods. His notes let him organize **Penny Auctions**, where farmers intimidate bidders to stop foreclosure sales.

### Huey Long – Governor of Louisiana

The "Kingfish" is a populist showman with absolute control over his state and a massive national radio audience. His answer to the Depression is radical wealth redistribution: **Share Our Wealth**. Cap personal fortunes. Guarantee every family a home, a job, an income.[^29] In committee, he can bypass the other leaders and speak directly to the public through the airwaves. His notes let him expand his Share Our Wealth clubs across the country—and build a political machine powerful enough to challenge the presidency itself.

### William Green – President, American Federation of Labor

Green leads the conservative wing of organized labor. Unlike Lewis, he believes in working within the system: negotiating with bosses, not threatening them. He can deal directly with industrialists like Swope, trading strike prevention for concessions. In committee, his goal is protecting the craft unions and keeping more radical labor movements from gaining ground. His notes let him lobby Congress for protective legislation while distancing the AFL from socialist influences.[^31]

### Charles Curtis – Vice President of the United States

Curtis is a veteran Kansas politician and the administration's bridge to agricultural interests in the Midwest. He can influence the Senate, break tie votes, and use parliamentary procedure to accelerate or stall legislation. In committee, his goal is simple: keep the Republican Party in power despite the catastrophe. His notes let him coordinate with GOP governors across the country and manage the party's messaging as the crisis deepens.[^34]

## Issues Requiring Review

### Statement of the Problem – Timeline Inconsistency

- **Issue**: The original "Statement of the Problem" opened with "As of this morning, October 29, 1929"—but the committee is set in 1932. This creates confusion: are delegates in 1929 or 1932?
- **Recommendation**: Reframe the section to clearly reflect 1932 conditions (years into the Depression, banking crisis at its peak, Bonus Army already dispersed). The 1932 setting is consistent with the rest of the guide.

### Letter from the Chair

- **Issue**: This section is still a placeholder.
- **Recommendation**: Needs to be written by the committee chair before publication.
