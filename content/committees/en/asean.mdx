Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to ASEAN at JAMUN! This committee promises to be an engaging and rewarding experience as we focus on the important topic of labor laws and corporate accountability in the Southeast Asian region.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,
