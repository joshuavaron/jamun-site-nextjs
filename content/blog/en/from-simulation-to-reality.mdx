Multilateralism is the central mechanism in which the United Nations operates. By definition, multilateralism is "the process of organizing relations between groups of three or more states." In other words, the world must work together to achieve peace, security, and development. But how can we foster multilateral cooperation among the next generation of global citizens? The answer is Model UN.

Unlike typical classroom activities, Model UN exposes students to real-world challenges such as climate change, disarmament, refugee crises, and global health—issues that they would otherwise only encounter in textbooks. By simulating the United Nations, students engage in multilateral diplomacy, mirroring the very process that nations use to negotiate and solve global problems. As a result, students don't just learn about international relations—they experience them firsthand.

Throughout my journey as an advocate, I've been fortunate to attend the UN Commission on the Status of Women, where I've witnessed firsthand how Model UN shapes real-world activism. I have also had the distinct pleasure to meet so many young leaders whose activism can be traced back to their experiences in Model UN. One young advocate I met started her journey opposing child marriage after writing her first resolution on the topic in high school. That resolution wasn't just a classroom exercise—it was the beginning of a lifelong commitment to policy and advocacy.

I've also seen this transformation in my own life. Through participating in MUN, I gained the confidence, critical thinking, and public speaking skills that prepared me to step onto the real UN floor. I've been able to speak at the United Nations about financial education for young women—an opportunity I never would have had without my start in Model UN.

When students are given the opportunity to engage with pressing global challenges through this type of meaningful simulation, they develop into informed, engaged advocates. They begin to see the world not as an abstract set of problems, but as an interconnected system of challenges and solutions. And most importantly, they realize that they have a role to play in shaping global outcomes.

This is why Model UN matters. It doesn't just reflect the mission of the United Nations—it empowers the next generation to carry that mission forward.
