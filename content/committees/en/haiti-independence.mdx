Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to Haiti's Independence at JAMUN! This crisis committee promises to be an intense and dynamic experience as you step into one of history's most significant revolutionary moments.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,
