**(a)** **The problem**: Rising temperatures, natural disasters

**(b)** **The need**: Worldwide regulations, collaboration

**(c)** **The opportunity**: Advances in renewable energy

**(d)** **The gap**: Shortage of climate scientists

### Specific Operative Clauses

Each operative clause includes specific, measurable elements:

**(a)** "45% from 2024 levels by 2030"

**(b)** "500,000 trees"

**(c)** "Nations with GDP above $1 trillion"

**(c)** Education and research (Clauses 4, 5)

**(d)** Waste reduction (Clause 6)

### Funding Mechanisms

The resolution addresses how initiatives will be funded:

**(a)** Support from wealthy nations (Clause 2b)

**(b)** IMF and UN member donations (Clause 5c)
