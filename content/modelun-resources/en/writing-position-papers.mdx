A position paper is one of the most important documents you'll write for Model UN. It demonstrates your preparation to your chairs, organizes your thoughts before committee begins, and serves as a reference throughout the conference. A well-written position paper can also earn you the Best Position Paper award.

This guide covers everything you need to know to write position papers that impress chairs and prepare you for success in committee.

## What Is a Position Paper?

A position paper is a brief document (typically one page) that outlines your assigned country's position on the topics your committee will discuss. It serves several purposes:

**(a)** **Demonstrates preparation**: Chairs use position papers to assess how well delegates have researched their country and the topic.

**(b)** **Organizes your thoughts**: The writing process forces you to think through your country's stance and potential solutions.

**(c)** **Provides a reference**: During committee, you can refer back to your position paper for key points and policy positions.

**(d)** **Enables recognition**: Many conferences give awards for exceptional position papers.

## Position Paper Structure

A standard position paper has three main sections, plus a header. Each section has a specific purpose and should flow logically into the next.

### Header

The header identifies your document and should include:

**(a)** Your country name

**(b)** Your committee name

**(c)** The topic title

**(d)** Your name and school (if required by the conference)

### Section 1: Background and Context

This section demonstrates your understanding of the issue. It should answer: What is this topic about, and why does it matter?

#### Elements to Include

**(a)** **Brief overview of the topic**: What is the issue? Define key terms if needed.

**(b)** **Why this issue matters globally**: What are the stakes? Who is affected?

**(c)** **Historical context**: How did this situation develop? What has been tried before?

**(d)** **Current state of affairs**: What is happening right now? What makes this urgent?

#### Tips for This Section

**(1)** Keep it concise—this is context, not a research paper. A few sentences to one paragraph is sufficient.

**(2)** Focus on information that's relevant to your country's position.

**(3)** Reference specific UN actions, resolutions, or treaties if relevant.

**(4)** Avoid spending too much time on general background that all delegates would know.

### Section 2: Your Country's Position

This is the heart of your position paper. It should answer: What does your country think about this issue, and why?

#### Elements to Include

**(a)** **How this topic affects your country**: Is your country directly impacted? How?

**(b)** **Your country's official stance**: What position has your government taken?

**(c)** **Past actions and policies**: What has your country done domestically? What positions has it taken at the UN?

**(d)** **Alliances and partnerships**: Which other countries share your views? What regional or international groups does your country work with on this issue?

#### Tips for This Section

**(1)** Use evidence to support your positions. Reference votes, statements, treaties, or domestic policies.

**(2)** Stay in character—write as if you are your country's representative, not as yourself.

**(3)** Explain the reasoning behind your country's positions. Why does your country feel this way?

**(4)** Acknowledge complexity if your country's position is nuanced or has evolved.

### Section 3: Proposed Solutions

This section demonstrates your ability to think constructively. It should answer: What should the committee do about this issue?

#### Elements to Include

**(a)** **Specific policy proposals**: What concrete actions do you want the committee to take?

**(b)** **Why these solutions would work**: How would your proposals address the problem?

**(c)** **Implementation details**: How would your solutions be carried out? Who would be responsible?

**(d)** **Willingness to collaborate**: Express openness to working with other delegates.

#### Tips for This Section

**(1)** Be specific. "Increase funding for education" is weak. "Establish a UN fund to support primary education in Least Developed Countries, funded by voluntary contributions from developed nations" is stronger.

**(2)** Make sure your solutions align with your country's position and interests.

**(3)** Propose solutions that are realistic and within the UN's capabilities.

**(4)** Consider including 2-3 proposals to show depth of thinking.

## Writing Style and Tone

Position papers require a specific writing style that differs from academic essays or creative writing.

### Maintain a Diplomatic Tone

**(a)** Write formally and professionally.

**(b)** Avoid emotional language or personal opinions.

**(c)** Use diplomatic phrases like "The delegation of [Country] believes..." or "[Country] supports..."

**(d)** Be respectful even when discussing opposing viewpoints.

### Write in Character

**(a)** Always write from your country's perspective, not your own.

**(b)** Even if you personally disagree with your country's position, represent it faithfully.

**(c)** Use "the delegation of [Country]" or "[Country]" rather than "I" or "we."

### Be Concise and Clear

**(a)** Position papers are typically limited to one page. Every sentence should add value.

**(b)** Avoid unnecessary words, filler phrases, and repetition.

**(c)** Use clear, direct language. Avoid jargon unless it's standard UN terminology.

**(d)** Organize your thoughts logically so readers can follow your argument.

### Use Evidence Effectively

**(a)** Support claims with specific references to UN documents, votes, statements, or policies.

**(b)** Statistics and specific facts strengthen your arguments.

**(c)** You don't need formal citations, but do reference your sources generally.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learning what not to do is as important as learning what to do. Watch out for these common pitfalls:

### Writing as Yourself Instead of Your Country

**(a)** Never include your personal opinions. You are representing a nation, not yourself.

**(b)** Even if your country's position is controversial or something you disagree with, represent it accurately.

**(c)** Avoid phrases like "I think" or "In my opinion."

### Being Too Vague

**(a)** Generic statements like "this is an important issue" waste space and don't demonstrate preparation.

**(b)** Vague proposals like "improve the situation" show lack of research.

**(c)** Include specific details, numbers, examples, and concrete policies.

### Ignoring Your Country's Actual Position

**(a)** Don't make up positions that sound good—research what your country actually thinks.

**(b)** Your solutions should align with your country's stated interests and values.

**(c)** If your country has taken a controversial stance, represent it anyway. That's the simulation.

### Proposing Unrealistic Solutions

**(a)** Avoid solutions that violate national sovereignty without justification.

**(b)** Don't propose actions beyond the UN's actual authority.

**(c)** Consider whether your proposals are financially and practically feasible.

### Going Over the Page Limit

**(a)** Respect page limits—chairs read many position papers and appreciate concision.

**(b)** If you're over the limit, cut background information first; keep your solutions.

**(c)** Edit ruthlessly. Every sentence should earn its place.

## Example Opening Paragraphs

Here are examples of strong opening sections for different scenarios:

### Example 1: Climate Change (Developed Country)

> The Federal Republic of Germany recognizes climate change as one of the defining challenges of our time. As one of the world's leading industrial economies and a strong advocate for sustainable development, Germany has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 and has exceeded its Kyoto Protocol obligations. Germany believes that addressing climate change requires coordinated international action, shared but differentiated responsibilities, and substantial investment in green technology transfer to developing nations.

### Example 2: Refugee Crisis (Affected Region)

> The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan hosts one of the world's largest refugee populations relative to its size, with over 750,000 registered Syrian refugees as of 2024. Jordan has kept its borders open and provided education and healthcare to refugees despite significant strain on national resources. Jordan calls upon the international community to share responsibility for refugee protection through increased financial support, resettlement commitments, and sustainable solutions that address root causes of displacement.

### Example 3: Economic Development (Developing Country)

> The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, as one of Africa's fastest-growing economies and the second-most populous nation on the continent, is committed to sustainable development that lifts its people out of poverty. Ethiopia's Growth and Transformation Plan has achieved significant progress in infrastructure, agriculture, and manufacturing. Ethiopia advocates for development approaches that respect national sovereignty, prioritize technology transfer, and ensure that developing nations can industrialize without facing the same barriers that developed nations have now imposed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should a position paper be?

Most conferences expect one page, though some may allow two. Check your conference's specific requirements. If no limit is specified, aim for one page—brevity demonstrates your ability to communicate effectively.

### Should I write a separate paper for each topic?

If your committee has multiple topics, you may need a position paper for each. Check your conference requirements. Some conferences ask for all topics in one document; others want separate papers.

### Can I use the same position paper for multiple conferences?

You can use similar research, but you should customize each position paper for the specific conference, committee, and topic. Different conferences may have slightly different topic framings or focus areas.

### What if I can't find my country's official position?

If you can't find a direct statement, look for positions on similar issues, voting records, regional bloc positions, or general foreign policy principles. You can make reasonable inferences based on your country's interests and values, but be prepared to justify your reasoning.

### How important are position papers for awards?

This varies by conference. Some give substantial weight to position papers; others focus primarily on committee performance. Regardless, strong position papers prepare you for better committee performance, so they're worth the effort.

### Should I submit my position paper early?

Yes, if the conference allows early submission. Early submission shows preparation and gives chairs more time to review your work. It also ensures you don't risk missing deadlines due to technical issues.

A strong position paper is the foundation of a successful Model UN experience. It forces you to think through your country's positions before committee begins, demonstrates your preparation to chairs, and gives you a reference document throughout the conference. Take the time to research thoroughly, write clearly, and edit carefully. Your future self in committee will thank you.
