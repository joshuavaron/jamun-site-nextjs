A great bloc doesn't happen by luck, especially for new delegates. It's built from simple but vital habits: a clear goal, friendly outreach and communication, organized teamwork, and respectful diplomacy. If you're new to JAMUN or Model UN, think of your bloc as a small team working together to create a variety of solutions to solve one problem. Below are some key ideas to help you form a bloc that gets things done and helps every member grow.

## Start with one sentence.

Before recruiting anyone, write a single, clear sentence that explains your bloc's purpose. For example: "We want a practical funding program for renewable energy projects" or "We aim to protect the human rights of climate migrants." This sentence keeps discussions focused and helps you explain your bloc quickly during unmoderated caucuses. When other delegates know what you want, they can decide faster whether to join.

## Open the conversation early.

Don't wait for someone else to approach you. At the beginning of an unmoderated caucus—or even before the first session—introduce yourself to nearby delegates and share your one-sentence purpose. Ask a specific question, like, "Would you be interested in drafting a realistic clause on funding?" Direct, small asks are easier to accept and help avoid vague commitments. Remember, ten committed members who communicate clearly will outperform a chaotic group of twenty that never agrees.

## Keep organization simple and inclusive.

Instead of fixed roles, focus on shared responsibilities that every bloc should practice:

- **Drafting together** - Use multiple pieces of paper or notebooks where anyone can add or suggest language (but ensure your draft resolution is legible!).
- **Quick consensus checks** - After brainstorming new ideas, gauge approval using simple methods like thumbs up/down or hand-raising before finalizing and presenting text to the floor.
- **Coaching each other** - Give feedback on speeches and writing, and encourage members to prepare short speaking notes and practice with one another.

This approach avoids unnecessary centralization, keeps all delegates engaged, and ensures everyone is learning.

## Communicate clearly and often.

Use a chat group or stay with your bloc during breaks to share ideas and track progress. Label drafts (Draft 1, Draft 2, etc.) to build efficiently on previous work. When clauses change, make notes in the margins, e.g., "Changed Article 4: merged clauses on funding and oversight into Article 4a." Transparent updates prevent confusion and keep all delegates involved.

## Practice unified messaging.

Before presenting a clause, agree on a two- or three-sentence summary everyone can use. This ensures your bloc sounds organized and credible without silencing anyone.

## Negotiate with respect.

Hold your core ideas but be ready to trade lesser points for stronger alliances. If another bloc suggests a helpful change, acknowledge it publicly: "Thanks, that makes the clause much more implementable." Respectful negotiation builds goodwill and increases future support.

## Celebrate and reflect.

After votes, thank co-sponsors and seek quick feedback from those who opposed your proposals. Use their insights to revise and improve. A bloc that learns together grows together, ultimately becoming a bloc that wins together.

In short, define your bloc in one sentence, recruit with specific asks, organize around shared responsibilities, maintain clear communication, present consistent messaging, and negotiate respectfully. Forming a perfect bloc is less about dramatic speeches and more about making collaboration easy. Be proactive, stay organized, prioritize open communication, and treat every delegate as a teammate. When collaboration is smooth and participation is real, your bloc will not only win votes but also develop stronger, more confident delegates. Aim for progress, not perfection, and you'll leave committee with a better resolution and a stronger group of leaders.
