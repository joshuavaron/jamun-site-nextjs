Public speaking is one of the most important skills you'll develop in Model UN. Whether you're delivering a formal speech to the entire committee, participating in a fast-paced moderated caucus, or presenting your bloc's resolution, strong speaking skills will help you communicate your ideas effectively and build influence with other delegates.

This guide covers everything from preparation and speech structure to delivery techniques and common mistakes to avoid. With practice, you'll transform from a nervous first-time delegate into a confident, persuasive speaker.

## Preparing to Speak

Great speeches start long before you stand up to address the committee. Thorough preparation builds the confidence you need to speak persuasively.

### Research Your Content

**(a)** Know your country's position thoroughly before committee begins. You should be able to explain your country's stance without looking at your notes.

**(b)** Prepare key talking points on likely discussion topics. Think about the main arguments you want to make and the evidence that supports them.

**(c)** Anticipate counterarguments from countries with opposing views. Knowing what others might say helps you prepare responses and strengthens your own arguments.

**(d)** Research specific facts, statistics, and examples you can reference. Concrete details make your speeches more memorable and credible.

### Mental Preparation

**(a)** Take deep breaths before speaking to calm your nerves. Nervousness is normal, even for experienced delegates.

**(b)** Visualize yourself giving a successful speech. Mental rehearsal builds confidence and reduces anxiety.

**(c)** Remember that everyone in the room wants you to succeed. Chairs, fellow delegates, and advisors are all rooting for you.

**(d)** Focus on your message rather than yourself. When you concentrate on what you're saying instead of how you look or sound, nervousness fades into the background.

### Physical Preparation

**(a)** Stand tall with good posture. Confident body language actually helps you feel more confident.

**(b)** Make eye contact with the dais when speaking. This shows respect and helps you connect with your audience.

**(c)** Keep your hands visible and relaxed—not in your pockets or crossed defensively. Open body language projects confidence.

**(d)** Dress professionally. When you look the part, you feel more prepared to play the part.

## Speech Structure

Different speaking situations in Model UN call for different approaches. Here's how to structure your remarks for each context.

### Formal Speeches (Speakers' List)

Speakers' list speeches are your opportunity to address the entire committee and establish your country's position. With 90 seconds of speaking time, every word counts.

#### Opening (15 seconds)

**(a)** Begin with a formal greeting: "Honorable Chair, fellow delegates..."

**(b)** State your country name clearly.

**(c)** Preview your main point or thesis in one sentence.

#### Body (60-70 seconds)

**(a)** Present your country's position on the topic clearly and directly.

**(b)** Provide evidence, examples, or statistics that support your stance.

**(c)** Connect your country's interests to the broader international issue.

**(d)** Propose or express support for specific solutions.

#### Closing (15 seconds)

**(a)** Summarize your key point in one sentence.

**(b)** Include a call to action—what do you want other delegates to do?

**(c)** Thank the committee for their attention.

**(d)** Yield your remaining time appropriately.

### Moderated Caucus Speeches

Moderated caucuses are focused discussions on specific sub-topics. With shorter speaking times (typically 30-60 seconds), you need to be even more concise.

#### Focus Your Message

**(a)** Make one main point per speech. Don't try to cover everything.

**(b)** Directly address the specific caucus topic announced by the Chair.

**(c)** Build on or respond to what previous speakers have said. This shows you're actively listening and engaging with the debate.

#### Structure for Impact

**(a)** Quick greeting (5 seconds): "Thank you, Chair. The delegation of [Country]..."

**(b)** Main point with supporting evidence (45 seconds): State your position, provide one strong piece of support, and explain why it matters.

**(c)** Conclusion or call to action (10 seconds): End with a clear statement of what should happen next.

### Presenting Resolutions

When presenting your bloc's draft resolution, you need to convince the committee that your approach is the best solution.

#### Before Presenting

**(a)** Know every clause in your resolution thoroughly. You may be asked detailed questions.

**(b)** Coordinate with your co-sponsors on who will present which sections.

**(c)** Anticipate questions and prepare answers in advance.

#### During the Presentation

**(a)** Briefly explain the overall approach and goals of your resolution.

**(b)** Highlight the most important operative clauses and explain why they'll be effective.

**(c)** Address potential concerns preemptively if you know certain clauses may be controversial.

**(d)** Invite questions and answer them confidently and specifically.

## Delivery Techniques

How you say something is just as important as what you say. These techniques will help you deliver your speeches with impact.

### Voice

**(a)** Project from your diaphragm so everyone in the room can hear you clearly. Speaking too quietly is one of the most common mistakes new delegates make.

**(b)** Vary your pace strategically. Slow down to emphasize important points and speed up slightly for less critical information.

**(c)** Use pauses effectively. A brief pause before or after a key point draws attention to it. Pauses also give you time to collect your thoughts.

**(d)** Eliminate filler words like "um," "like," "you know," and "so." These undermine your credibility and distract from your message.

### Body Language

**(a)** Stand confidently with your feet shoulder-width apart and your weight evenly distributed.

**(b)** Use purposeful hand gestures to emphasize points, but don't overdo it. Natural, controlled movements are best.

**(c)** Make eye contact across the entire room, not just with the Chair or one section of delegates.

**(d)** Move deliberately if you need to adjust your position. Avoid nervous swaying, pacing, or fidgeting.

### Presence and Confidence

**(a)** Own your space at the podium or speaking position. You have the floor—use it.

**(b)** Show conviction in your words through your tone and expression. If you don't seem to believe what you're saying, neither will anyone else.

**(c)** Maintain diplomatic composure even when discussing passionate topics or responding to criticism.

**(d)** Stay composed under pressure. If you lose your train of thought, pause, take a breath, and continue. Everyone understands.

## Building Strong Arguments

Persuasive speeches are built on solid arguments. Use these techniques to make your points more compelling.

### Argument Structure

**(1)** State your claim clearly and directly. Don't make the audience guess what point you're making.

**(2)** Provide evidence that supports your claim. This could be statistics, examples, expert opinions, or historical precedents.

**(3)** Explain the significance of your evidence. Don't assume the connection is obvious—spell out why your evidence proves your point.

**(4)** Connect your argument to your country's values and interests. This reinforces that you're representing your nation's perspective.

### Rhetorical Devices

**(a)** **Rule of Three**: Group related points in sets of three. "This resolution promotes peace, prosperity, and progress." Threes are memorable and satisfying.

**(b)** **Rhetorical Questions**: Engage your audience by asking questions you then answer. "Can we afford to ignore this crisis? The delegation of France believes we cannot."

**(c)** **Repetition**: Emphasize key points by restating them in different ways. "We must act now. The time for delay has passed. Today is the day for action."

**(d)** **Contrast**: Highlight differences to make your position clearer. "While some nations propose waiting, we propose acting. While some see obstacles, we see opportunities."

### Handling Questions and Challenges

**(a)** Listen completely to any question before formulating your response. Don't interrupt or assume you know what's being asked.

**(b)** Pause briefly to organize your thoughts. A moment of silence is better than a rambling, unfocused answer.

**(c)** Address the specific question that was asked. Don't dodge or pivot to unrelated topics.

**(d)** Stay in character as your country's representative. Even if you personally disagree with your country's position, defend it diplomatically.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learning what not to do is just as important as learning what to do. Watch out for these common pitfalls.

### Speaking Too Fast

**(a)** Nervousness naturally speeds up your speaking pace. Be aware of this tendency and consciously slow down.

**(b)** Practice your speeches at a deliberately slower pace than feels natural. What feels slow to you often sounds just right to listeners.

**(c)** Use pauses as natural speed bumps. Pause between sentences and after important points.

### Reading from Paper

**(a)** Notes are helpful, but reading word-for-word kills your connection with the audience.

**(b)** Use bullet points or key phrases rather than full sentences in your notes.

**(c)** Practice enough that you can maintain eye contact while glancing at notes occasionally.

**(d)** Know your content well enough that notes are a safety net, not a script.

### Apologizing or Undermining Yourself

**(a)** Never start with phrases like "Sorry, but..." or "I'm not sure if this is right, but..." These undermine your credibility before you even make your point.

**(b)** Don't apologize for taking the committee's time. You have the floor because you have something valuable to contribute.

**(c)** Own your position confidently, even if you're new to Model UN.

### Using Informal Language

**(a)** Maintain diplomatic language throughout. Avoid slang, casual phrases, or overly colloquial expressions.

**(b)** Address other delegates formally: "the distinguished delegate of France" or "the representative of Brazil."

**(c)** Refer to yourself in the third person as "the delegation of [Country]" rather than "I" or "we."

### Going Over Time

**(a)** Practice with a timer to develop an internal sense of how long your speeches run.

**(b)** Prepare a shortened version of any speech in case you need to cut material.

**(c)** Watch for the Chair's time signals and wrap up gracefully when time is running low.

**(d)** Ending on time shows respect for procedure and other delegates.

## Speech Templates

Use these templates as starting points, then customize them for your country and topic.

### Opening Statement Template

> "Honorable Chair, distinguished delegates, the delegation of [Country] is honored to address this committee on the critical issue of [Topic]. As a nation that has [relevant experience or stake in the issue], [Country] believes that [position statement]. Today, we will outline our commitment to [goal] and propose concrete solutions for [specific aspect of the topic]."

### Moderated Caucus Template

> "Thank you, Chair. On the matter of [specific caucus topic], [Country] firmly believes that [clear position]. We have seen [evidence or example] demonstrate that [supporting point]. Therefore, [Country] urges this committee to [specific action or approach]."

### Closing Statement Template

> "In conclusion, the delegation of [Country] calls upon all member states to [specific action]. Together, we can [desired outcome]. [Country] stands ready to work with all willing partners to achieve this goal. We yield the remainder of our time to the Chair."

### Resolution Presentation Template

> "Honorable Chair, the sponsors of Draft Resolution [number/name] are pleased to present our approach to [topic]. Our resolution focuses on [main goals]. The key operative clauses include [highlight 2-3 important clauses and briefly explain each]. We believe this approach will [expected outcomes]. The sponsors welcome any questions from the committee."

## Practice Exercises

Consistent practice is the key to improving your public speaking skills. Try these exercises regularly.

### Mirror Practice

**(a)** Stand in front of a mirror and deliver your speech while watching your body language.

**(b)** Practice making eye contact with your reflection.

**(c)** Work on eliminating nervous habits you can see yourself doing.

**(d)** Experiment with hand gestures until they feel natural.

### Timed Runs

**(a)** Practice delivering 60-second and 90-second speeches until you can hit the time naturally.

**(b)** Write speeches that run slightly longer than the time limit, then practice cutting them down on the fly.

**(c)** Use a stopwatch app to track your timing and identify patterns.

### Recording and Review

**(a)** Record yourself on your phone giving a speech.

**(b)** Listen for filler words, pacing issues, and clarity of your points.

**(c)** Watch the video to evaluate your body language and eye contact.

**(d)** Be kind to yourself—everyone cringes at recordings of themselves at first.

### Practice with Others

**(a)** Practice with friends, family, or MUN club members to simulate the committee environment.

**(b)** Ask for specific feedback: Was I clear? Did I speak too fast? Did I make eye contact?

**(c)** Take turns giving speeches and providing constructive feedback to each other.

**(d)** Practice answering unexpected questions to build your ability to think on your feet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I forget what I was going to say?

Take a breath and pause. A moment of silence feels longer to you than to your audience. Glance at your notes if needed, then continue. If you truly lose your place, summarize what you've said so far—this often helps you remember what comes next.

### How do I calm my nerves before speaking?

Deep breathing is the fastest way to reduce physical anxiety. Take three slow, deep breaths before standing up. Also remember that some nervousness is actually helpful—it keeps you alert and energized. The goal isn't to eliminate nerves but to channel them productively.

### What if someone asks a question I can't answer?

It's okay to say "The delegation of [Country] would need to consult further on that specific point" or "That falls outside our current policy position, but we would be happy to discuss it further during unmoderated caucus." Never make up information.

### How can I improve quickly before a conference?

Focus on three things: know your content cold, practice out loud multiple times, and time yourself. Even a few days of focused practice makes a noticeable difference. Record yourself once and fix the biggest issues you notice.

The best speakers in Model UN aren't born with natural talent—they become great through practice and experience. Every speech you give is an opportunity to improve. Don't be discouraged by early struggles; every experienced delegate remembers being nervous at their first conference. Keep practicing, stay curious, and embrace each chance to speak as a learning opportunity.
