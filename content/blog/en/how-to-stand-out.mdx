Every Model UN delegate enters committee with the same goal in mind: to make an impact. While it may seem that your success in committee depends on how often you speak or how many resolutions have your name on them, the truth is often a bit more complex. Standing out requires thorough preparation and a strong presence, but it is ultimately about finding the balance between asserting your ideas and respecting those of others.

One thing that is important to note is that "standing out" does not mean dominating every conversation, as this can often alienate others who feel their voices are not being heard. The most memorable delegates are not always the loudest, but rather the ones who bring thoughtful ideas and cooperation to the table. No matter which committee you are in, there are a few key strategies that will set you apart in meaningful ways.

One key way to establish yourself as a dedicated delegate is by seizing your first chance to speak with a strong opening speech. This is your initial opportunity to capture the attention of your fellow delegates and committee chairs by laying the foundation for a clear and compelling position on the topic. A common but effective way to begin is with a striking fact, pun, or example that highlights the importance of the issue and previews possible ways to solve it. From there, you should define your country's stance on the subject and offer a vision of solutions you would like your committee or bloc to pursue. A confident delivery, even in a short speech, will leave a lasting impression on the rest of the committee.

Once debate moves forward, it is crucial to understand that unmoderated caucuses become equally important as the speeches you deliver. This is where blocs are formed and initial collaboration takes place. At this point, you must become increasingly aware of balancing initiative with inclusivity. Judges look for delegates' ability to voice their opinions while also listening to the group when necessary. Additionally, delegates who can guide discussions, divide tasks, and help their bloc stay on schedule become crucial to how quickly the group moves.

Another key way to distinguish yourself is through resolution and directive drafting, as writing strong clauses requires precision and creativity. Instead of broad, vague statements, focus on specific actions that connect directly to real-world policy and can efficiently achieve solutions that work for all delegates. Volunteering to type or organize a draft gives you significant influence, but with that responsibility comes the need to respect your bloc's consensus and not just insert your own ideas.

Finally, professionalism plays a critical role in the way you are perceived. Small actions like arriving on time, dressing appropriately, and engaging respectfully—whether related to committee topics or not—add to your credibility. Networking during breaks, checking in with the chair, and acknowledging the contributions of other delegates are little ways to stand out without coming on too strong.

At the end of the conference, the delegates who leave the largest impacts are those who combine strong speeches, effective teamwork, clear writing, and professional diplomacy. Ultimately, standing out is not simply about being noticed, but about leaving a positive impression of leadership, collaboration, and substantive contributions to the work achieved throughout the conference.
