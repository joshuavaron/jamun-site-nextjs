Welcome to the JAMUN Delegate Handbook! Whether this is your first conference or your tenth, this guide will help you feel confident and prepared. We're excited to have you join us!

## Introduction to Model UN

Model United Nations (MUN) is an academic simulation of the United Nations where students learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the UN. In 1945, fifty-one nations signed the UN Charter, creating an organization dedicated to preventing war and promoting peace through international collaboration. MUN brings this mission to life in the classroom.

As a delegate, you'll role-play as a representative from a country and work with others to solve real-world issues from your assigned nation's perspective. MUN is about more than just debate—it's about collaboration, creative problem-solving, and understanding different perspectives. Don't worry if you're new; everyone starts somewhere, and our chairs and staff are here to help you succeed!

## Types of Committees

At JAMUN, you may participate in different types of committees:

### General Assembly (GA)

General Assembly committees are larger committees, typically with 50-150 delegates. Debate moves through formal speeches, moderated caucuses, and unmoderated caucuses as delegates work together to draft and pass resolutions. GA committees are great for delegates who enjoy working with large groups and want to develop their core MUN skills.

### Specialized and Regional Bodies

These committees function similarly to General Assemblies but are usually smaller (30-75 delegates) and focus on specific issues or regions. Examples include ECOSOC committees, regional bodies like the African Union, and specialized agencies like WHO or UNHCR.

### Crisis Committees

Crisis committees are fast-paced, smaller committees (15-30 delegates) where the situation evolves throughout the conference. In addition to regular debate, delegates write private "crisis notes" to take individual actions that can change the course of events. Crisis committees reward quick thinking, creativity, and multitasking.

## First-Time Delegates

New to Model UN? Welcome! Here's what you need to know to hit the ground running:

### Before the Conference

- **Research your country:** Learn about your country's government, economy, foreign policy, and position on your committee's topic. Check out our Country Research Guide for help!
- **Write your position paper:** This helps you organize your thoughts and shows your chairs you've prepared.
- **Read the background guide:** Your chairs have written a guide explaining the topic—read it carefully.
- **Practice speaking:** Even just a few minutes in front of a mirror can help build confidence.

### What to Bring

- Your research notes and position paper
- A notebook and pens for taking notes
- A water bottle and snacks for breaks
- Formal attire (see Dress Code below)
- A positive attitude and willingness to learn!

### Tips for Success

- **Don't be afraid to speak:** Your voice matters! Start with a short speech or a point—every contribution counts.
- **Ask questions:** If you're confused about procedure, raise a Point of Inquiry. Chairs are happy to help.
- **Work with others:** Find allies who share your country's views and collaborate on working papers.
- **Stay in character:** Remember, you're representing your country, not your personal opinions—even if you disagree with them!
- **Have fun:** MUN is meant to be enjoyable! Don't stress too much about making mistakes.

## Research and Preparation

Good preparation is the foundation of a successful MUN experience. Here's how to get ready:

### Researching Your Country

- **Background:** Explore your country's history, geography, political system, and economy. Understanding where your country comes from helps explain its current positions.
- **Political Leadership:** Know who leads your country and their influence on foreign policy. Research recent elections and political shifts.
- **Economic Interests:** Understand your country's key industries, trade partners, and economic challenges. Economic interests often drive foreign policy positions.
- **Regional Relationships:** Examine your country's relationships with neighbors and regional alliances. Who are your allies? Who are your rivals?
- **UN Involvement:** Look at your country's history in the UN—voting patterns, treaties signed, and past statements on your topic.

### Researching Your Topic

- **Read the background guide:** This is your starting point! Your chairs have done significant research to help you.
- **Find your country's position:** Search for official government statements, UN speeches, and voting records related to your topic.
- **Identify relevant UN resolutions:** What has the UN already done on this issue? What treaties exist?
- **Develop solutions:** Come up with creative, realistic ideas. Don't be afraid to think outside the box!

## Rules of Procedure

The following is a summary of how committee sessions work. For the complete rules, see our official Rules of Procedure document.

### Roll Call

At the beginning of each session, the Chair will conduct a roll call. When your country is called, respond with one of the following:

- **"Present"** — You may abstain on substantive votes
- **"Present and Voting"** — You must vote yes or no on substantive votes (no abstaining)

### Speakers' List

The speakers' list is the default mode of debate. Raise your placard to be added to the list, and when called upon, you'll have **90 seconds** to address the committee. After speaking, you may yield your remaining time to the Chair or to another delegate.

### Moderated Caucus

A moderated caucus is a focused discussion on a specific sub-topic. To propose one, raise your placard and specify:

- Total time (e.g., "10 minutes")
- Speaking time (e.g., "1 minute" — this is the maximum allowed)
- Topic (e.g., "Discussing funding mechanisms")

The delegate who proposes the caucus may request to speak first or last. If you want to speak during the caucus, raise your placard and the Chair will call on delegates.

### Unmoderated Caucus

An unmoderated caucus is informal time where you can leave your seat, walk around, and talk directly with other delegates. This is when most negotiation and working paper drafting happens! Maximum duration is **20 minutes**.

### Points

Points allow you to communicate with the Chair:

- **Point of Order:** Something procedurally incorrect is happening. May be raised at any time.
- **Point of Inquiry:** You have a question about procedure. Raise when there's no active speaker.
- **Point of Personal Privilege:** You can't hear, see, or have a personal comfort concern. Raise when there's no active speaker.
- **Point of Information:** A question directed to the current speaker. Only with the Chair's consent during a speech.

### Common Motions

Motions allow you to change what the committee is doing:

- **Motion for Moderated Caucus:** Start a focused discussion
- **Motion for Unmoderated Caucus:** Start informal negotiation time
- **Motion to Open the Speakers' List:** Open or reopen the speakers' list
- **Motion to Close Debate:** End debate and move toward voting
- **Motion to Enter Voting Procedure:** Begin voting on draft resolutions
- **Motion to Suspend:** Take a recess

Most motions require a simple majority to pass. The Chair may rule a motion "dilatory" (obstructing progress) and choose not to entertain it.

## Strategy and Diplomacy

Success in MUN comes from more than just knowing the rules—it's about working effectively with others. Here are some strategies to help you excel:

### The Flow of Debate

General Assembly committees typically move through four phases:

1. **Opening Debate:** Delegates speak about the topic and their country's position. Use this time to identify potential allies and signal your willingness to collaborate.
2. **Working Papers:** Small coalitions form to draft informal documents. This is where relationships matter—find delegates who share your views and start writing together.
3. **Draft Resolutions:** Coalitions merge their working papers into formal draft resolutions. Be flexible and collaborative, but make sure your key ideas are included.
4. **Voting:** The committee votes on resolutions. Present your resolution confidently and be prepared to answer questions.

### Building Alliances

- **Identify key players early:** Notice which delegates are active, knowledgeable, and influential. Try to work with them.
- **Form coalitions:** Work with like-minded countries to create a unified front. Regional blocs (EU, African Union, etc.) are natural starting points.
- **Mention other delegates:** In your speeches, reference delegates you want to work with: "The delegation of France looks forward to collaborating with Germany on this issue."
- **Be inclusive:** Welcome others into your coalition. The more support you have, the better your resolution's chances.

### Effective Participation

- **Deliver a strong opening speech:** Clearly state your position, goals, and willingness to work with others.
- **Be active in moderated caucuses:** Raise your placard and speak often. Consistent participation keeps you visible.
- **Use unmoderated caucuses wisely:** Don't just sit with your coalition—network with other groups, gather signatories, and explore compromises.
- **Ask strategic questions:** When others present resolutions, ask questions that highlight issues or reinforce your position.

### Diplomatic Tips

- **Stay professional:** Even when debates get heated, remain courteous and diplomatic.
- **Be flexible:** Compromise is essential. Know which of your positions are negotiable and which are not.
- **Play the mediator:** If two groups are in conflict, offer to help find common ground. This positions you as a leader.
- **Use silence strategically:** Sometimes it's better to listen first and respond thoughtfully.

## Writing Resolutions

Resolutions are the final product of your committee's work—formal documents proposing solutions to the topic at hand.

### Working Papers

Before a resolution, you'll likely draft working papers. These are informal documents to develop and share ideas. They don't need sponsors or signatories, so feel free to experiment! Working papers are a great way to test ideas and attract collaborators.

### Draft Resolutions

When your ideas are ready, you can formalize them into a draft resolution. You'll need:

- **Sponsors:** The main authors of the resolution (maximum 5% of committee, rounded up). Sponsors present the resolution and can accept friendly amendments. Try to be a sponsor—it shows leadership!
- **Signatories:** Delegates who want to see it debated, even if they don't fully agree (minimum 20% of committee, rounded down). Gather signatories during unmoderated caucuses.

### Resolution Format

Resolutions are written as long sentences with two main parts:

- **Preambulatory Clauses:** Introduce the resolution by outlining the issues and context. Begin with an *italicized* phrase like *"Noting," "Recognizing," "Aware of," "Deeply concerned,"* etc. Each clause ends with a comma.
- **Operative Clauses:** The actual proposals and actions. Begin with an **underlined** phrase like *"Calls upon," "Recommends," "Urges," "Requests,"* etc. These are numbered and end with semicolons (except the last one, which ends with a period).

### Tips for Strong Resolutions

- **Be specific:** Clearly address the problem with detailed, actionable solutions.
- **Be realistic:** Propose solutions that are feasible and within the UN's capabilities.
- **Build broad support:** Include ideas from multiple perspectives to attract votes.
- **Respect sovereignty:** Avoid solutions that infringe on national sovereignty unless absolutely necessary.
- **Consider funding:** Think about how your proposals will be paid for—this is a common point of criticism.

### Amendments

Want to change a draft resolution? You can propose an amendment:

- **Friendly amendments:** If all sponsors agree, the change is automatically incorporated.
- **Unfriendly amendments:** If sponsors don't all agree, the amendment needs its own sponsors and signatories, and the committee votes on it.

Be prepared to negotiate on amendments. Know which parts of your resolution are essential and which you can compromise on.

## Voting

There are two types of votes:

- **Procedural votes:** Votes on motions (like starting a caucus). Everyone must vote—no abstentions allowed. Simple majority wins.
- **Substantive votes:** Votes on resolutions and amendments. You may abstain if you responded "Present" during roll call. Simple majority of non-abstaining votes wins.

Any delegate may request a roll call vote, where each country is called individually to vote "Yes," "No," "Abstain," or "Pass" (pass lets you vote at the end).

## Delegate Conduct

Model UN simulates real diplomacy, so we ask delegates to act professionally:

- Refer to yourself in the third person as "The delegate of [country]"
- Address other delegates through the Chair (e.g., "The delegate would like to ask the delegate of France...")
- Maintain diplomatic courtesy at all times—personal attacks are never acceptable
- Be respectful of all perspectives, cultures, and backgrounds
- Use electronic devices only with the Chair's permission

### Dress Code

Delegates are expected to wear formal attire during committee sessions. We understand that "formal" means different things in different cultures and for students from different backgrounds. Acceptable attire includes suits, dresses, slacks, blouses, and blazers. We politely ask that you avoid clothing with distracting logos, messages, or images.

## Awards

At JAMUN, we recognize outstanding delegates with awards. While awards aren't everything, they're a nice way to celebrate your hard work!

### Award Categories

- **Best Delegate:** The top performer in the committee
- **Outstanding Delegate:** Exceptional performance
- **Honorable Mention:** Notable contribution to committee
- **Best Position Paper:** Exceptional research and writing in your position paper

### What Chairs Look For

- **Preparation:** Knowledge of your country's position and the topic
- **Diplomacy:** Working well with others, building coalitions, and finding compromise
- **Speaking:** Clear, persuasive, and confident speeches
- **Leadership:** Taking initiative in writing papers and guiding debate
- **Procedure:** Understanding and correctly using rules of procedure
- **Growth:** Chairs love to see delegates improve throughout the conference!

Remember: awards recognize great work, but the real reward is the skills you build and the friends you make. Focus on learning and having fun, and success will follow!

## Final Thoughts

Model UN can feel overwhelming at first, but we promise it gets easier—and more fun—with practice. Don't be afraid to make mistakes; that's how we all learn. Your chairs and the JAMUN staff are here to support you every step of the way.

**We can't wait to see you in committee. Good luck, and happy debating!**
