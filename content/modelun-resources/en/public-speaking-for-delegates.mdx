## Speaking with Confidence

Public speaking is a core skill in Model UN. Whether you're giving a formal speech or participating in caucus, these tips will help you communicate effectively.

### Before Your Speech

1. **Know your content**: Research thoroughly so you speak with authority
2. **Outline key points**: Don't memorize word-for-word
3. **Practice aloud**: Get comfortable with your voice
4. **Breathe deeply**: Calm your nerves before speaking

### During Your Speech

#### Body Language
- Stand tall with good posture
- Make eye contact around the room
- Use hand gestures naturally
- Avoid fidgeting or swaying

#### Voice
- Speak loudly and clearly
- Vary your tone to maintain interest
- Pause for emphasis
- Don't rush through your points

### Speech Structure

**Opening**: Grab attention with your first sentence
**Body**: Present 2-3 key points with evidence
**Closing**: End with a strong call to action

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Reading directly from notes
- Speaking too quietly
- Using filler words ("um", "like")
- Going over time
- Ignoring your audience
