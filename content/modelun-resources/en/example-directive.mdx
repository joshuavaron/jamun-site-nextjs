## What Makes This Directive Effective

### Creative Title (Acronym)

**(a)** The directive uses an acronym that spells out a meaningful word: **DUSTIN**.

**(b)** This makes the directive memorable and shows creativity.

**(c)** The full name describes the directive's purpose clearly.

### Clear Operative Structure

Each main clause starts with a strong action verb in the present tense:

**(a)** "**Creates**" — establishing something new

**(b)** "**Establishes**" — setting up a structure

**(c)** "**Calls upon**" — requesting action from others

### Logical Hierarchy

The directive uses a clear nesting structure:

**(a)** **Numbers (1, 2, 3)** for main operative clauses

**(b)** **Letters (a, b, c)** for sub-points

**(c)** **Roman numerals (i, ii)** for further details

### Specific and Actionable

Each clause contains specific, actionable items rather than vague statements:

**(a)** "Two conferences per year, one in the spring and one in the fall"

**(b)** "Students in 5th-8th grade"

**(c)** "Dustin Simon will create a spreadsheet"

### Addresses Implementation

The directive considers practical implementation:

**(a)** Who will do what (specific individuals named)

**(b)** Backup plans (physical mail if emails fail)

**(c)** Structure and organization (the Secretariat system)

## Key Takeaways for Writing Directives

**(1)** **Start each clause with an action verb**: Create, Establish, Direct, Move, Call upon, Authorize.

**(2)** **Be specific**: State exactly what should happen and who is responsible.

**(3)** **Use proper formatting**: Numbered clauses with lettered sub-clauses and roman numeral details.

**(4)** **Consider implementation**: Think about how your directive will actually work in practice.

**(5)** **Create a memorable title**: Acronyms or creative names help your directive stand out.

**(6)** **Keep it focused**: Address the immediate situation or goal rather than trying to solve everything.

**(7)** **Plan for contingencies**: Include backup plans where appropriate.
