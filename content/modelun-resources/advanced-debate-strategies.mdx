## Elevating Your Debate Skills

Once you've mastered the basics, these advanced strategies will help you become a more effective delegate.

### Building and Leading Blocs

**Identifying Allies**: Look for countries with similar interests on the topic. Regional groups, economic partners, and ideological allies are natural starting points.

**Bloc Leadership**: Guide discussion, delegate tasks, and ensure everyone contributes. A good bloc leader brings out the best in their coalition.

**Managing Conflicts**: When bloc members disagree, find compromise language that satisfies all parties.

### Strategic Motion-Making

- **Timing matters**: Move for a moderated caucus when momentum is on your side
- **Topic selection**: Choose caucus topics that highlight your country's strengths
- **Speaking time**: Shorter caucuses (30-45 seconds) favor prepared delegates

### Negotiation Tactics

1. **Listen more than you speak**: Understand others' priorities
2. **Find the overlap**: Look for shared interests
3. **Trade strategically**: Give on less important points to win on key ones
4. **Create urgency**: Time pressure can move negotiations forward

### Parliamentary Maneuvering

- **Amendments**: Use friendly and unfriendly amendments strategically
- **Division of the question**: Separate controversial clauses for individual votes
- **Motion hierarchy**: Know which motions take precedence

### Award-Winning Delegate Traits

- Consistent and accurate representation of country position
- Effective coalition building and leadership
- Strong speaking and writing skills
- Constructive participation throughout the conference
