Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to the American Civil War (Union) at JAMUN! This crisis committee promises to be an intense experience as you take on the roles of key Union leaders during America's most divisive conflict.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,

Joshua Varon

Founder, JAMUN
