Dear Delegates,

We are so excited to welcome you to the Sudan Civil War at JAMUN! This crisis committee promises to be a challenging and meaningful experience as you grapple with one of the most complex humanitarian crises of our time.

We will be updating this page shortly with our background guides and letters from your committee chairs. In the meantime, feel free to explore the topic and start thinking about your country's position.

We can't wait to see you at committee!

Best regards,

Joshua Varon

Founder, JAMUN
