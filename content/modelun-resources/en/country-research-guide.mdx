Effective country research is the foundation of successful Model UN participation. When you truly understand your assigned country—its history, interests, alliances, and positions—you can represent it authentically and engage meaningfully with other delegates. This guide walks you through everything you need to know to become an expert on your country before committee begins.

## Step 1: Basic Country Profile

Start by gathering fundamental information about your country. This background knowledge informs everything else you research and helps you understand why your country takes certain positions on international issues.

### Geography

**(a)** Learn where your country is located in the world and identify its neighboring countries. Geographic location shapes foreign policy in profound ways—landlocked countries face different challenges than island nations, and neighbors often become either close allies or historic rivals.

**(b)** Research what natural resources your country possesses. Oil, minerals, fertile land, and fresh water often drive economic interests and foreign policy decisions. A country rich in oil has very different priorities than one that must import all its energy.

**(c)** Consider what climate and geographical challenges your country faces. Droughts, flooding, lack of arable land, rising sea levels, or extreme temperatures all affect a country's policy priorities and international concerns.

**(d)** Think about your country's strategic importance. Does it control important waterways like the Suez Canal or Strait of Malacca? Does it sit at a crossroads of trade routes? Does it border regions of conflict? Strategic location affects how other countries treat your nation.

### Demographics

**(a)** Research your country's population size and whether it is growing, shrinking, or aging. A rapidly growing population creates different challenges (jobs, housing, education) than an aging population (healthcare, pensions, workforce shortages).

**(b)** Understand the ethnic and religious composition of your country. This often influences domestic politics, foreign relations with neighboring countries, and positions on human rights issues. Know the major groups and any historical tensions between them.

**(c)** Learn what languages are spoken and which are official. This can reveal colonial history, regional ties, and cultural connections to other nations.

**(d)** Consider the distribution between urban and rural populations. This affects development priorities, economic policies, and how your country approaches issues like agriculture, infrastructure, and urbanization.

### Economy

**(a)** Determine your country's GDP and its classification as developed, developing, or a Least Developed Country (LDC). This fundamentally shapes your country's priorities in international negotiations—developed nations often have different concerns than developing ones.

**(b)** Identify major industries and primary exports. A country that exports oil has different trade interests than one that exports agricultural products or manufactured goods. Know what your country sells to the world and what it needs to buy.

**(c)** Research key economic challenges your country faces. High unemployment, inflation, debt, income inequality, or dependence on a single export commodity all shape policy positions.

**(d)** Understand your country's most important trade relationships and economic partnerships. Who are your biggest trading partners? What free trade agreements or economic blocs is your country part of?

### Government

**(a)** Learn about your country's political system. Is it a democracy, monarchy, one-party state, military government, or something else? How does power work in your country?

**(b)** Know who the current leaders are. Research the head of state, head of government (if different), and key ministers, especially the foreign minister. Understanding their political backgrounds and ideologies helps you predict policy positions.

**(c)** If applicable, research the major political parties and their platforms. Knowing which party is in power and what they stand for helps you understand current policy directions.

**(d)** Consider how stable the government is. Has there been recent political turmoil, elections, or changes in leadership? Recent political changes often shift foreign policy priorities.

## Step 2: Foreign Policy Research

Once you understand your country's basic profile, dive deeper into how it interacts with the rest of the world. Foreign policy is shaped by geography, history, economics, and ideology.

### Alliances and Blocs

**(a)** Identify which regional organizations your country belongs to. Examples include the European Union, African Union, ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Arab League, or Organization of American States. Membership in these organizations often determines voting patterns and policy positions.

**(b)** Research whether your country is part of any military alliances like NATO, or collective security arrangements. Security partnerships reveal who your country trusts and who it fears.

**(c)** Examine economic partnerships and trade agreements your country has signed. Free trade agreements, customs unions, and development partnerships shape economic interests.

**(d)** Understand which voting blocs your country aligns with in the United Nations. This helps you identify natural allies in committee.

### Key Relationships

**(a)** Identify your country's major allies. Which countries does it cooperate with most closely on security, economic, and diplomatic matters? Strong bilateral relationships often transcend regional groupings.

**(b)** Research historical adversaries and understand why tensions exist or existed. Even if relationships have improved, historical conflicts often influence current attitudes.

**(c)** Know your country's most important trade partners and what goods and services flow between them. Economic interdependence shapes diplomatic relationships.

**(d)** If your country receives foreign aid, know who the major donors are. If it provides aid, know where that assistance goes. Aid relationships create both influence and obligation.

### UN Engagement

**(a)** Research how your country has voted on General Assembly resolutions, particularly those related to your committee's topic. Voting records reveal consistent patterns in policy.

**(b)** Examine which major treaties and conventions your country has ratified, signed but not ratified, or refused to sign. Treaty positions reveal values and priorities.

**(c)** Understand your country's contributions to the UN budget. Is your country a major funder or a recipient of UN programs? Financial contributions affect influence and interests.

**(d)** Learn whether your country participates in peacekeeping operations. Peacekeeping contributions demonstrate commitment to international security and often reflect regional interests.

## Step 3: Topic-Specific Research

After building a general understanding of your country, focus on how it relates specifically to your committee's topic. This is where your research becomes most directly useful for debate.

### Domestic Impact

**(a)** Examine how the issue your committee is discussing affects your country directly. Is this a major concern or a peripheral issue? The more an issue affects your country, the stronger your position will likely be.

**(b)** Research what domestic policies your country has implemented to address this issue at home. Domestic policy often mirrors international positions.

**(c)** Gather relevant statistics about your country. If discussing climate change, know your country's emissions levels and climate vulnerabilities. If discussing education, know literacy rates and school enrollment. If discussing health, know disease prevalence and healthcare access. Specific numbers strengthen your speeches.

### Historical Position

**(a)** Research how your country has voted on past UN resolutions related to this topic. Consistent voting patterns reveal entrenched positions that are unlikely to change.

**(b)** Find statements your country's representatives have made in UN forums about this issue. Speeches in the General Assembly, Human Rights Council, or other bodies reveal official positions.

**(c)** Know which relevant treaties your country has signed or rejected and understand why. Treaty positions often define the boundaries of what your country will accept.

**(d)** Research what actions your country has taken in the past to address this issue, both domestically and internationally. Past actions often predict future positions.

### Current Policy

**(a)** Find official government statements about the topic from recent years. Government websites, ministry press releases, and official speeches provide authoritative positions.

**(b)** Research any recent initiatives or programs your country has launched related to the issue. New initiatives suggest priority areas.

**(c)** Understand what resources your country has committed to addressing this problem. Budget allocations reveal real priorities beyond rhetoric.

**(d)** Identify your country's stated goals and priorities regarding this topic. What outcomes is your country seeking?

## Step 4: Research Sources

Knowing where to find reliable information is just as important as knowing what to look for. Use a variety of sources to build a complete picture.

### Official Sources

**(a)** The United Nations website (un.org) is your best source for resolutions, voting records, and official UN documents. Learn to navigate the UN document system to find relevant materials.

**(b)** Your country's Permanent Mission to the UN often has a website with statements and position papers. Search for "[Country name] permanent mission UN" to find it.

**(c)** Government websites with .gov domains (or country-specific equivalents) provide official policy information directly from the source.

**(d)** Look for statements from your country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for diplomatic positions on international issues.

### News Sources

**(a)** International news organizations like BBC, Reuters, and the Associated Press provide balanced coverage of global events. These help you understand current developments.

**(b)** Read newspapers from your assigned country to understand how issues are perceived domestically. Search for English-language media from your country, or use translation tools if needed.

**(c)** Regional news sources offer perspectives that international outlets might miss. Al Jazeera for Middle East perspectives, The East African for East Africa, South China Morning Post for Asia—regional sources provide valuable context.

**(d)** Academic journals provide in-depth analysis and historical context, though they may be less current than news sources.

### Data Sources

**(a)** The World Bank (worldbank.org) provides comprehensive economic data and development indicators for nearly every country. Use their country profiles for statistics.

**(b)** The International Monetary Fund (imf.org) offers detailed economic analysis and forecasts. Their country reports provide expert assessments.

**(c)** The World Health Organization (who.int) has health statistics and policy information. Their country profiles are essential for health-related topics.

**(d)** The UNDP Human Development Index ranks countries by quality of life indicators beyond just economic measures. This provides a broader picture of development.

### Think Tanks and Research Organizations

**(a)** The Council on Foreign Relations (cfr.org) provides accessible analysis of international issues with a US perspective. Their backgrounders are excellent starting points.

**(b)** Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (chathamhouse.org), offers British and European perspectives on global affairs.

**(c)** The Brookings Institution (brookings.edu) publishes in-depth policy research on a wide range of topics.

**(d)** Look for think tanks based in your country's region for perspectives closer to home. Every region has research institutions that provide valuable local analysis.

## Step 5: Understanding Positions

The most important part of research is understanding not just what your country's positions are, but why it holds them. This deeper understanding allows you to argue persuasively and respond to unexpected situations in committee.

### Historical Context

**(a)** Consider how colonial history has shaped your country's worldview and relationships with other nations. Former colonies often have complicated relationships with former colonial powers, and colonial borders created many of today's conflicts.

**(b)** Research past conflicts your country has experienced and how they influence current security concerns. Wars, invasions, and civil conflicts leave lasting marks on national psychology and policy.

**(c)** Understand the cultural influences that have shaped your country's values and perspectives. Religion, philosophy, and cultural traditions affect how countries approach issues like human rights, family policy, and international cooperation.

**(d)** Examine your country's economic development path and how it affects views on issues like trade, aid, and environmental policy. Countries that industrialized early often have different perspectives than those still developing.

### National Interests

**(a)** Identify your country's primary security concerns. What threats does it face, and how does it seek to address them? Security interests often override other considerations.

**(b)** Understand your country's economic priorities. Which industries does it want to protect? Which markets does it want to access? Economic interests drive many foreign policy positions.

**(c)** Consider how your country seeks to maintain or expand its regional and global influence. Prestige and influence matter in international relations.

**(d)** Think about how domestic politics shape foreign policy. Leaders often take international positions that appeal to their domestic audiences. Elections, political pressures, and public opinion all influence what positions countries can take.

### Ideological Factors

**(a)** Understand your country's political ideology and how it shapes approaches to international cooperation and sovereignty. Some countries prioritize multilateral cooperation while others emphasize national sovereignty.

**(b)** Consider how religious beliefs or secular values influence policy positions on issues like human rights, gender equality, or family policy.

**(c)** Research cultural values that are important in your country and how they affect international positions. Concepts like individual rights vs. collective welfare, tradition vs. modernization, or environmental protection vs. economic development vary across cultures.

**(d)** Understand your country's development philosophy. Does it favor state-led development, free markets, or a mixed approach? Economic ideology shapes positions on trade, aid, and development assistance.

## Step 6: Finding Your Bloc

In Model UN, delegates rarely work alone. Understanding which countries share your interests helps you find allies and build coalitions that can pass resolutions.

### Geographic Blocs

The United Nations organizes countries into five regional groups for electoral and organizational purposes. Knowing your regional group is essential.

**(a)** **The African Group** includes all 54 African nations. The group often coordinates on development issues, post-colonial concerns, and African Union priorities.

**(b)** **The Asia-Pacific Group** is the largest and most diverse, spanning from the Middle East to the Pacific Islands. This group includes very different countries with varying interests.

**(c)** **The Eastern European Group** includes former Soviet states and countries that were part of the Eastern Bloc. Many are now EU members with different priorities than before.

**(d)** **The Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC)** coordinates on regional issues and often shares perspectives on development, democracy, and relations with the United States.

**(e)** **The Western European and Others Group (WEOG)** includes Western Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel. Members often align on human rights, democratic governance, and market economics.

### Issue-Based Groups

Beyond geographic blocs, countries form coalitions around shared interests that cross regional lines.

**(a)** **The G77 plus China** is a coalition of developing nations that often coordinate on economic and development issues. Despite its name, it now includes over 130 countries.

**(b)** **European Union member states** frequently speak and vote as a bloc on many issues, with the EU delegation presenting common positions.

**(c)** **The Arab League** coordinates positions on Middle Eastern affairs and issues affecting Arab and Muslim-majority countries.

**(d)** **Small Island Developing States (SIDS)** work together on climate change, ocean issues, and sustainable development—matters that threaten their very existence.

**(e)** **Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs)** face unique challenges in trade and development and often coordinate their positions on transit rights and infrastructure.

**(f)** **The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)** historically represented countries not aligned with major Cold War powers. It continues to advocate for developing country interests and multilateralism.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much time should I spend on research?

Plan to spend at least several hours researching your country and topic before a conference. Start with the basics (1-2 hours), then dive deeper into topic-specific research (2-3 hours). The more you research, the more confident you'll feel in committee.

### What if I can't find my country's position on the topic?

If you can't find a direct statement, look for positions on similar issues, regional bloc positions your country might align with, or general foreign policy principles that would apply. You can also make informed inferences based on your country's interests and values.

### Should I research other countries too?

Yes, but strategically. Research your natural allies to understand their positions, and research major opponents to anticipate their arguments. Knowing the positions of key players makes you more effective in debate.

### What if my country's position conflicts with my personal views?

This is common and actually valuable. Model UN teaches you to understand and articulate perspectives different from your own. Stay in character and represent your country faithfully—you can discuss your personal views outside of committee.
