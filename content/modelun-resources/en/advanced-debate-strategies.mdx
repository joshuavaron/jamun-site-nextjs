Once you've mastered the basics of Model UN—parliamentary procedure, speech structure, and resolution writing—it's time to develop the advanced skills that separate good delegates from great ones. This guide covers sophisticated strategies for coalition building, negotiation, parliamentary maneuvering, and overall committee success.

These techniques require practice and experience to master, but understanding them will accelerate your development as a delegate and increase your chances of success at competitive conferences.

## Building and Leading Blocs

In Model UN, you rarely succeed alone. The most effective delegates build strong coalitions that amplify their influence and pass their resolutions.

### Identifying Potential Allies

Before committee begins, research which countries might share your positions:

**(a)** **Regional partners**: Countries from the same geographic region often vote together on many issues.

**(b)** **Economic allies**: Countries with similar economic systems or trade relationships may align on economic issues.

**(c)** **Ideological alignment**: Countries with similar political systems or values often share positions on governance and human rights issues.

**(d)** **Issue-specific coalitions**: On specific topics, unexpected allies may emerge based on shared interests.

### Early Coalition Formation

The beginning of committee is crucial for bloc building:

**(a)** **Signal early**: In your opening speeches, indicate willingness to work with others and mention specific countries or groups you want to collaborate with.

**(b)** **Pass notes strategically**: During the first moderated caucuses, pass notes to potential allies suggesting collaboration.

**(c)** **Use the first unmod wisely**: Don't wait—immediately approach like-minded delegates to start forming a working group.

**(d)** **Be inclusive**: The larger your coalition, the better your chances of passing resolutions. Don't exclude countries unnecessarily.

### Bloc Leadership

Leading a bloc requires different skills than individual participation:

**(a)** **Facilitate, don't dominate**: A good bloc leader draws out contributions from all members rather than doing everything themselves.

**(b)** **Delegate tasks**: Assign different delegates to draft different clauses, gather signatories, or speak on specific topics.

**(c)** **Keep momentum**: Set deadlines, check progress, and keep the group focused on producing a quality resolution.

**(d)** **Manage conflicts**: When bloc members disagree, find compromise language that incorporates multiple perspectives.

**(e)** **Share credit**: Acknowledge bloc members' contributions publicly. This builds loyalty and strengthens the coalition.

### Managing Bloc Dynamics

**(a)** **Handle freeloaders diplomatically**: If someone isn't contributing, give them specific tasks that match their strengths.

**(b)** **Prevent fractures**: Watch for signs of disagreement and address them before they split the bloc.

**(c)** **Stay flexible**: Be willing to modify your ideas if the bloc consensus differs from your original vision.

**(d)** **Maintain relationships**: Even after your bloc succeeds or fails, keep good relationships for future committees.

## Strategic Motion-Making

The motions you make—and when you make them—can significantly impact debate and your standing in committee.

### Timing Your Motions

**(a)** **Ride momentum**: Move for a moderated caucus when debate is going your way. This extends favorable discussion.

**(b)** **Change direction**: If debate is working against your position, an unmoderated caucus can break momentum and let you regroup.

**(c)** **Early vs. late**: Early moderated caucuses let you shape the debate's direction. Later caucuses let you respond to what's already been said.

**(d)** **Watch the clock**: Be aware of session timing. Propose unmods before breaks to maximize coalition work time.

### Choosing Caucus Topics

**(a)** **Highlight your strengths**: Choose topics where your country has expertise or strong positions.

**(b)** **Frame advantageously**: The way you phrase the topic influences the discussion. "Discussing financing mechanisms" is different from "Discussing the burden on developing nations."

**(c)** **Be specific enough**: Topics that are too broad lead to unfocused discussion. Topics that are too narrow may not generate enough interest.

**(d)** **Anticipate speakers**: Consider who will want to speak on your topic and whether that helps your goals.

### Speaking Time Strategy

**(a)** **Shorter times favor the prepared**: In 30-45 second caucuses, delegates who have clear, practiced points have an advantage.

**(b)** **Longer times favor depth**: 60-second caucuses allow for more developed arguments and evidence.

**(c)** **Consider the room**: If many delegates want to speak, shorter times allow more participation and may make your motion more popular.

## Advanced Negotiation Tactics

Negotiation is the backbone of Model UN success. Advanced delegates approach negotiation strategically.

### Preparation

**(a)** **Know your priorities**: Before negotiation, identify your must-haves, nice-to-haves, and areas where you can compromise.

**(b)** **Understand others' interests**: Research what other key countries want. Look for potential trades.

**(c)** **Develop alternatives**: Know your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). This gives you negotiating power.

### Active Negotiation Techniques

**(a)** **Listen more than you speak**: You learn more by listening. Understanding others' positions helps you find creative solutions.

**(b)** **Ask questions**: "Why is that important to your country?" uncovers underlying interests that may enable compromise.

**(c)** **Look for value creation**: Instead of zero-sum bargaining, look for solutions that give everyone something they want.

**(d)** **Trade strategically**: Give on less important points to win on key ones. Never give without getting.

**(e)** **Use objective criteria**: When arguing for your position, reference UN principles, past resolutions, or expert opinions rather than just your preferences.

### Managing Difficult Negotiations

**(a)** **Separate people from positions**: Don't take disagreements personally. A country opposing your proposal isn't attacking you.

**(b)** **Focus on interests, not positions**: Behind every position is an underlying interest. Find the interest and you can often find a solution.

**(c)** **Generate options before deciding**: Brainstorm multiple possibilities before committing to one approach.

**(d)** **Create urgency strategically**: Deadlines and time pressure can move stalled negotiations forward.

**(e)** **Know when to walk away**: Sometimes the best negotiation outcome is no deal. Don't compromise core interests just to reach agreement.

### Coalition Negotiation

**(a)** **Negotiate within your bloc first**: Resolve internal disagreements before approaching other blocs.

**(b)** **Designate a spokesperson**: Have one person lead external negotiations to ensure consistent messaging.

**(c)** **Consider bloc mergers**: If two blocs have similar positions, merging creates a stronger coalition.

**(d)** **Manage the merger process**: When merging, be clear about whose ideas get included and how sponsorship is shared.

## Parliamentary Maneuvering

Understanding parliamentary procedure deeply allows you to use it strategically.

### Using Amendments

**(a)** **Friendly amendments**: Use these to strengthen your own resolution by adding good ideas from other delegates.

**(b)** **Unfriendly amendments**: Use these to weaken opposing resolutions or to get your ideas included in resolutions you don't sponsor.

**(c)** **Defensive amendments**: If you anticipate criticism, preemptively address it with an amendment to your own resolution.

**(d)** **Amendment timing**: Propose amendments early enough to allow debate but late enough that you've identified weaknesses.

### Advanced Procedural Tactics

**(a)** **Division of the question**: If a resolution has both strong and weak clauses, you can move to vote on clauses separately. This can salvage good ideas from flawed resolutions.

**(b)** **Motion hierarchy**: Know which motions take precedence. A well-timed motion can interrupt unfavorable proceedings.

**(c)** **Points of order**: Use these sparingly and only for genuine procedural violations. False points harm your credibility.

**(d)** **Roll call votes**: Request these when you want individual countries' votes on the record, or when you think visible voting might change outcomes.

### Managing Debate Flow

**(a)** **Extend favorable debate**: When things are going well, move for additional moderated caucuses on the same topic.

**(b)** **Close unfavorable debate**: When debate works against you, moving to voting procedure or shifting to a new topic can help.

**(c)** **Control the speakers' list**: Strategic positioning on the speakers' list lets you either respond to others or set the agenda.

## Reading the Room

Great delegates are constantly assessing the committee environment and adapting their approach.

### Understanding Committee Dynamics

**(a)** **Identify power centers**: Notice which delegates are influential. Building relationships with them amplifies your impact.

**(b)** **Track alliances**: Keep mental (or written) notes on who is working with whom. Alliances shift—stay updated.

**(c)** **Gauge chair preferences**: Without pandering, notice what kinds of contributions chairs seem to value.

**(d)** **Read the opposition**: Understand what the other side wants and why. This helps you counter their arguments and find compromises.

### Adapting Your Strategy

**(a)** **Pivot when needed**: If your original approach isn't working, be willing to change course.

**(b)** **Fill gaps**: Notice what the committee needs—a mediator, a leader, a creative thinker—and fill that role.

**(c)** **Time your contributions**: Sometimes it's better to listen early and contribute later when you have more information.

**(d)** **Balance visibility and collaboration**: Being too dominant can alienate others. Being too passive means you're overlooked.

## What Chairs Look For

Understanding evaluation criteria helps you focus your efforts effectively.

### Core Competencies

**(a)** **Accurate representation**: Consistently representing your country's actual positions, not generic or made-up positions.

**(b)** **Policy knowledge**: Demonstrating understanding of the topic, relevant UN history, and current affairs.

**(c)** **Speaking skills**: Clear, confident, well-organized speeches that advance the debate.

**(d)** **Writing skills**: Well-crafted resolutions and working papers with proper formatting.

**(e)** **Procedural knowledge**: Using parliamentary procedure correctly and appropriately.

### Leadership Qualities

**(a)** **Coalition building**: Successfully organizing and leading groups of delegates.

**(b)** **Diplomacy**: Working constructively with delegates of differing positions.

**(c)** **Problem-solving**: Contributing creative, realistic solutions to the committee's challenges.

**(d)** **Adaptability**: Responding effectively to changing circumstances and unexpected developments.

### Consistent Engagement

**(a)** **Active participation**: Speaking regularly in moderated caucuses and engaging during unmoderated time.

**(b)** **Constructive contributions**: Adding value to debate rather than just speaking for visibility.

**(c)** **Collaboration**: Working effectively with others, not just pursuing individual recognition.

**(d)** **Sustained effort**: Maintaining energy and engagement throughout the entire conference, not just at the beginning.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I balance leadership with collaboration?

Lead by example and facilitation, not by domination. The best leaders make their bloc members feel empowered and valued. Share credit generously, and focus on achieving bloc goals rather than personal recognition.

### What if my bloc falls apart?

It happens. Remain professional, try to understand what went wrong, and either rebuild relationships or find a new coalition. Don't burn bridges—you may need to work with those delegates later.

### How aggressive should I be with parliamentary maneuvering?

Use procedure to achieve substantive goals, not to obstruct or show off. Chairs notice and appreciate delegates who use procedure appropriately. Excessive procedural gaming can backfire.

### How do I stand out in a large committee?

Consistent quality matters more than quantity. Make every speech count, contribute meaningfully during unmods, and build strong relationships within a focused coalition rather than trying to be everywhere at once.

### What's more important: speaking or writing?

Both matter. Strong speakers who can't write effective resolutions won't succeed. Great writers who can't advocate for their work in debate will struggle too. Develop both skills.
