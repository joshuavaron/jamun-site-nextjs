## Understanding Parliamentary Procedure

Parliamentary procedure is the set of rules that govern how Model UN committees operate. Learning these basics will help you participate effectively.

### Points

**Point of Personal Privilege**: Use when you cannot hear, need to use the restroom, or have another personal need.

**Point of Order**: Use when you believe the rules are being broken.

**Point of Inquiry**: Use to ask the chair a procedural question.

### Common Motions

**Motion to Open Debate**: Begins formal discussion on a topic.

**Motion to Set the Agenda**: Determines which topic to discuss first.

**Motion for a Moderated Caucus**: Request structured speaking time on a specific sub-topic.

**Motion for an Unmoderated Caucus**: Request informal discussion time.

**Motion to Close Debate**: Ends discussion and moves to voting.

### Voting

- **Placard Vote**: Raise your placard to vote yes/no
- **Roll Call Vote**: Each country's vote is recorded individually
- **Consensus**: All countries agree without formal vote

### Pro Tips

1. Listen carefully to what's happening
2. Start with simple motions before complex ones
3. Don't be afraid to ask the chair for clarification
4. Watch experienced delegates to learn
