Walking into your first mock trial competition can feel intimidating. The formal courtroom setting, the legal terminology, the pressure of being judged—it's a lot to take in. But here's a secret: everyone feels that way at first, and with the right preparation, you'll be surprised how quickly it all clicks.

After coaching dozens of first-time competitors, I've identified the five things that make the biggest difference.

## 1. Know Your Case Inside and Out

This might seem obvious, but you'd be surprised how many students underestimate this. Don't just read the case materials once—live with them.

**What this looks like in practice:**

- Read through all witness statements multiple times
- Create a timeline of events
- Identify inconsistencies and potential weaknesses
- Know what every witness said, not just your own
- Understand the legal standards involved

> The best attorneys know the case so well they can answer any question without looking at their notes.

The more familiar you are with the facts, the more confident you'll feel when things don't go exactly as planned—and they won't.

## 2. Practice Out Loud (A Lot)

There's a huge difference between knowing what you want to say and actually saying it well. Your opening statement might look perfect on paper, but does it sound natural when you deliver it?

**Practice tips:**

- Record yourself and watch it back (uncomfortable but incredibly useful)
- Practice in front of family members who can ask tough questions
- Time your statements to make sure you're within limits
- Practice standing—your posture and movement matter

Don't memorize word-for-word. Instead, know your key points cold, then practice expressing them in different ways. This flexibility will save you when you forget a word or get interrupted.

## 3. Listen More Than You Speak

During cross-examination, new competitors often focus so much on their prepared questions that they miss what the witness is actually saying. Some of the best impeachment opportunities come from listening carefully and following up on unexpected answers.

**Listening skills to develop:**

- Take notes during direct examination
- Watch for nervous habits that might indicate discomfort
- Notice when answers are vague or evasive
- Be ready to adapt your cross based on what you hear

The attorneys who stand out are the ones who can think on their feet. That only comes from genuine engagement with what's happening in the courtroom.

## 4. Embrace Objections

Objections scare a lot of beginners, but they're actually your friend. A well-timed objection shows the judges you understand the rules of evidence. Even if your objection is overruled, making it demonstrates competence.

**Common objections to master:**

- **Hearsay** - An out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter
- **Leading** - Questions that suggest the answer (only allowed on cross)
- **Relevance** - Evidence that doesn't matter to the case
- **Speculation** - Asking a witness to guess
- **Narrative** - Letting a witness ramble without specific questions

Don't object just to object—have a reason. But don't be afraid to stand up and say "Objection, Your Honor" when you see a violation.

## 5. Own Your Role

Whether you're an attorney or a witness, commit fully to your role. Witnesses should develop their character beyond what's in the affidavit. Attorneys should carry themselves with the confidence of real lawyers.

**For witnesses:**

- Create a backstory that explains your character's motivations
- Practice staying in character under pressure
- Know what your character would and wouldn't know
- Develop consistent mannerisms and speech patterns

**For attorneys:**

- Dress professionally
- Speak clearly and project your voice
- Make eye contact with judges and jury
- Move with purpose

## Final Thoughts

Your first competition isn't about winning—it's about learning. Pay attention to what works, what doesn't, and what you can improve for next time.

The students who become great at mock trial aren't necessarily the most naturally talented. They're the ones who put in the work, learn from each experience, and keep coming back.

I can't wait to see you in the courtroom. You've got this.
