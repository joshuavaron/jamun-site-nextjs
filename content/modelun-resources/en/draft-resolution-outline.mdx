This outline provides the standard format for writing draft resolutions in General Assembly committees. Follow this structure to create properly formatted resolutions that follow UN conventions.

## Header Information

Every draft resolution begins with a header containing essential information:

### Title

**(a)** Create a descriptive or creative title for your resolution.

**(b)** Acronyms are popular and make resolutions memorable.

**(c)** Example: *TGIF (Tackling Global Illicit Finance)* or *BREATHE (Better Regulations Eliminating Airborne Toxic Health Effects)*

### Committee Name

**(a)** Include the full name of your committee.

**(b)** Example: *United Nations General Assembly* or *Economic and Social Council*

### Sponsors

**(a)** List the main authors of the resolution.

**(b)** Maximum: 5% of committee members, rounded up.

**(c)** Example: *Germany, France, Japan, Brazil*

### Signatories

**(a)** List delegates who want the resolution brought to the floor for debate.

**(b)** Minimum: 20% of committee members, rounded down.

**(c)** Being a signatory does not require voting for the resolution.

**(d)** Example: *Canada, Australia, South Korea, Mexico, Kenya*

### Topic

**(a)** State the topic your resolution addresses.

**(b)** Example: *Addressing Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability*

## Preambulatory Clauses

Preambulatory clauses provide context and background for your resolution. They explain why the issue matters and what has been done before.

### Format

**(a)** Each clause begins with an *italicized* present participle (a verb ending in -ing).

**(b)** Each clause ends with a **comma**.

**(c)** Clauses are **not numbered**.

### Content

Preambulatory clauses typically include:

**(a)** References to past UN actions and resolutions

**(b)** Acknowledgment of the problem's scope and severity

**(c)** Recognition of existing efforts and their outcomes

**(d)** Expression of concern or appreciation regarding the situation

### Common Preambulatory Phrases

| Phrase | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| *Acknowledging* | Recognizing a fact or situation |
| *Affirming* | Confirming a principle or commitment |
| *Alarmed by* | Expressing concern about a serious situation |
| *Aware of* | Noting important background information |
| *Bearing in mind* | Considering relevant factors |
| *Believing* | Expressing conviction about a principle |
| *Confident* | Expressing trust in an outcome |
| *Deeply concerned* | Strong expression of worry |
| *Emphasizing* | Highlighting importance |
| *Fully aware* | Acknowledging with emphasis |
| *Guided by* | Following established principles |
| *Having considered* | After reviewing information |
| *Noting* | Observing a fact |

## Operative Clauses

Operative clauses are the action items—what the committee actually wants to happen. These are the heart of your resolution.

### Format

**(a)** Each clause begins with a **bolded** or *underlined* verb in the third person present tense.

**(b)** Clauses are **numbered** (1, 2, 3...).

**(c)** Sub-clauses use letters (a, b, c) and then roman numerals (i, ii, iii).

**(d)** Each clause ends with a **semicolon**, except the final clause which ends with a **period**.

### Content

Operative clauses typically include:

**(a)** Specific proposed actions and policies

**(b)** Establishment of committees, funds, or mechanisms

**(c)** Requests to member states or UN bodies

**(d)** Implementation details and timelines

**(e)** Funding mechanisms

### Important Note

Most UN committees (except the Security Council) cannot force action. Use verbs like *Requests*, *Encourages*, *Recommends*, and *Urges* rather than *Demands* or *Orders*.

### Common Operative Phrases

| Phrase | Strength | When to Use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| *Calls upon* | Strong | Urging specific action from states |
| *Decides* | Strongest | Making definitive committee decisions |
| *Demands* | Very strong | Urgent situations (use sparingly) |
| *Encourages* | Moderate | Suggesting voluntary action |
| *Endorses* | Moderate | Supporting existing initiatives |
| *Establishes* | Strong | Creating new mechanisms or bodies |
| *Further invites* | Soft | Additional suggestions |
| *Notes* | Soft | Acknowledging without action |
| *Proclaims* | Strong | Making declarations |
| *Recommends* | Moderate | Suggesting courses of action |
| *Requests* | Moderate | Asking for specific action |
| *Strongly condemns* | Very strong | Expressing severe disapproval |
| *Supports* | Moderate | Backing existing efforts |
| *Urges* | Strong | Pressing for important action |

### Example Operative Clause
