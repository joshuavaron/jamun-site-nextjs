## Getting Started with Country Research

When you're assigned a country in Model UN, the first step is understanding your nation's position on the committee's topic. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to become an expert on your country.

### Step 1: Learn the Basics

Start with general information about your country:
- Geographic location and neighbors
- Population and demographics
- Government structure
- Economic system
- Major historical events

### Step 2: Understand the Topic

Research how your country relates to the committee's topic:
- Has your country been directly affected?
- What policies does your country have on this issue?
- What has your country said in the UN about this topic?

### Step 3: Find Your Country's UN Voting Record

The UN Bibliographic Information System (UNBISnet) tracks how countries vote on resolutions. This helps you understand your country's consistent positions.

### Step 4: Read Recent News

Look for recent news articles about your country and the topic. This helps you understand current events and recent policy changes.
