3. **Citation gaps** - Some paragraphs contain facts without citations

### asean.mdx - ASEAN Labor Laws and Accountability

**Letter from Chair:** Needs complete rewrite for ASEAN topic

- Line 36: "no-man's land" in quotes with emdash before
- Line 46: emdash before list of "3D" jobs

**Style Notes:**
