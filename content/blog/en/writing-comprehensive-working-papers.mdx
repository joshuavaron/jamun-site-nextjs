Writing working papers and clauses can feel tricky at first, but it doesn't have to be. If you're new to JAMUN, think of a clause as a short instruction telling the United Nations what should happen. Strong clauses are clear, simple, and something other delegates can agree on. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you write clauses that gain support, win votes, and move your bloc forward.

## Start with one clear sentence.

Before you write anything, sum up the problem in one short sentence. For example: "Coastal towns are losing homes because of rising sea levels." This framing keeps your clause focused. Once you know the problem, it's much easier to explain what should be done.

## Use one or two quick facts.

Find one or two short facts that show why the problem matters. These could be a statistic ("X people affected by the crisis") or a short example ("island nation Y lost hundreds of homes"). Use these facts in your position paper or while explaining the clause—not in the clause itself. Keep the clause short and direct.

## Follow the "Who-What-How" rule.

Every strong clause should answer three questions:

- Who will act? (e.g., "United Nations Development Programme")
- What will they do? (e.g., "establish a small grant fund")
- How will it happen? (e.g., "within 12 months, with yearly reports")

Example clause: "Requests the United Nations Development Programme to create a small grant fund for coastal adaptation projects, with the first funds distributed within 12 months and yearly progress reports to the General Assembly."

Notice how this example clearly identifies who acts, what they do, and how it's implemented.

## Be specific but not bossy.

Avoid words that are too weak ("encourage") or too strict ("must punish immediately"). Choose balanced verbs like "establish," "create," "report," or "support." Add realistic timelines so delegates can imagine the plan in action.

## Break big ideas into smaller parts.

If your idea has multiple elements (funding, training, reporting), split them into sub-clauses. This makes it easier for other delegates to support some parts while negotiating others.

## Use consistent, simple language.

If you call something "adaptation," don't switch to "resilience" later unless you explain the difference. Stick to plain, direct sentences that make debate easier.

## Work together on drafts.

Share drafts with your bloc and refine them together. Keep a brief changelog so everyone knows what's been updated and why. Collaboration makes your clauses stronger.

## Test your clause out loud.

Before presenting, read your clause to a few fellow delegates. Ask: "Can you explain this in one sentence?" If they can, it's clear. If not, simplify.

## Have backup options.

Draft a main version and a softer version (for example, changing "establish" to "encourage the establishment of"). If someone objects, you'll have a compromise ready.

## Explain why it matters.

When presenting your clause, lead with its impact: "This clause protects 5,000 citizens by funding local sea walls." Delegates respond to clear benefits.

## Learn from feedback.

Whether your clause passes or not, ask for feedback. Each attempt helps you write stronger, more persuasive clauses in the future.

In essence: start with a clear problem statement, add a fact or two, follow the Who-What-How rule, use plain language, test your clause out loud, and prepare backup wording. Strong clauses are short, practical, and persuasive. With every draft, you'll become a more effective delegate—and see your ideas turn into real committee progress.
