I'm incredibly excited to share some big news: JAMUN has been awarded a $25,000 grant from the Education Foundation to expand our programs to underserved communities.

This grant represents a major milestone for our organization and will help us reach our goal of making academic competitions accessible to every middle schooler, regardless of their school's resources.

## What This Means for JAMUN

The grant will fund several key initiatives over the next year:

### 1. School Outreach Program

We'll be hiring our first part-time staff member to coordinate outreach to Title I schools in our region. Many schools want to participate in programs like Model UN, Mock Trial, and Mathletes but lack the resources or knowledge to get started. Our outreach coordinator will help bridge that gap.

### 2. Scholarship Fund

A significant portion of the grant will go toward scholarships for students who can't afford registration fees. Our goal is simple: no student should be unable to participate because of cost.

### 3. Resource Development

We're creating comprehensive starter kits for schools that want to launch their own academic competition programs. These kits will include:

- Training materials for faculty advisors
- Sample case files and practice problems
- Video tutorials from experienced competitors
- Template club constitutions and schedules

### 4. Transportation Assistance

One of the biggest barriers to participation is transportation. Many students can't attend conferences because their families can't provide rides. This grant will help us provide bus transportation from underserved areas to our events.

## The Numbers

Here's how we're planning to allocate the funds:

| Initiative | Amount | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Outreach Coordinator | $10,000 | 50+ schools contacted |
| Student Scholarships | $7,000 | 100+ students supported |
| Resource Development | $5,000 | Materials for 30 schools |
| Transportation | $3,000 | 200+ students transported |

## A Note of Gratitude

This grant wouldn't have been possible without the incredible work of our volunteer team. Over the past two years, you've helped us build something special—an organization that's already impacted 500+ students and counting.

Special thanks to:

- Our board members who helped write the grant application
- The teachers and administrators who provided letters of support
- The students who shared their stories about how JAMUN changed their lives
- Every volunteer who makes our programs run

> "JAMUN showed me that I could do things I never thought possible. Now other kids will have that same opportunity." — A student letter included in our application

## What's Next

We're hitting the ground running. In the next few months, you'll see:

- Our outreach coordinator position posted (if you know someone great, send them our way!)
- New school partnerships announced
- Updated registration with scholarship options
- Resource kit pilot program at select schools

## How You Can Help

Even with this grant, there's more work to do. Here's how you can contribute to our mission:

1. **Spread the word** - Know a school that should offer academic competitions? Connect us!
2. **Volunteer** - We always need coaches, judges, and mentors
3. **Donate** - Every dollar helps us reach more students
4. **Participate** - The best thing you can do is show up and be part of this community

## The Bigger Picture

When we started JAMUN, our dream was to prove that students could create something meaningful. This grant is validation that we're on the right track—but it's just the beginning.

Academic competitions changed my life. They taught me how to think critically, speak confidently, and work with people who have different perspectives. Every student deserves that opportunity.

With this funding, we're one step closer to making that vision a reality. Thank you for being part of this journey.

Let's keep making academics fun.
