## What is a crisis break?

Crisis breaks are short scenes acted out by JAMUN crisis staff every 15-30 minutes. These breaks evolve the committee's crisis storyline and require immediate responses from delegates.

## What is the backroom?

"The backroom" is an imaginary space where your character's private actions take place. You interact with it via **crisis notes**.

## What are crisis notes?

These are short letters your character writes to fictional or real figures outside the committee. Staff respond in character. Be creative and strategic.

*Example:* In a Civil War crisis, Ulysses S. Grant might write Abraham Lincoln requesting troops.

## What is a frontroom break?

When your crisis note affects the committee's plot directly and is incorporated into a live scene, you've "broken" into the frontroom.

## What is a directive?

Directives are short committee-wide documents outlining how the group responds to events. Passed by simple majority, they guide crisis progression and are often fast-paced.

## A Short Timeline of Backroom Arcs

### Phase 1: Establish Your Relationship

Decide who your character is writing to and why. Establish motivations and background early.

- *Example:* "It feels like just yesterday that we created ciphers behind Mr. Varon's back..."

Fictional characters are allowed! Just build a solid backstory and relationship.

### Build Up Your Resources

Start collecting assets and allies. These form the foundation for impactful later moves. Adapt based on the backroom's responses.

### Phase 2: Disruption

Use small actions (e.g. a skirmish, a leaked rumor) to test your arc's strength and gather momentum.

#### A Note Against War

Not every arc must be violent. Politics, negotiation, and diplomacy can be just as effective. Violent arcs carry both risks and rewards.

### Phase 3: Final Steps

Use all your resources to accomplish your main goal. Keep things realistic and proportional to what you've built throughout the committee.

## A Short Timeline of the Frontroom

The frontroom doesn't follow clear phases. Instead, it repeats a **cyclical pattern**:

- **Crisis Break:** Live action update from crisis staff.
- **Questions:** Clarify the scene.
- **Timed Crisis (Optional):** Solve a problem fast—fail, and face consequences.
- **Directive Writing:** Work in caucuses to create and promote directives.
- **Bloc Formation:** Allies may change with each crisis cycle.
- **Voting:** Directives are debated and voted on. Passed directives are sent to the backroom.

### A Couple Notes on the Crisis Frontroom

- Write crisis notes during moderated caucuses.
- Frontroom resembles GA procedure, just faster and more intense.
- Collaboration makes big moves more likely to succeed.
