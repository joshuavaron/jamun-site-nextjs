## Analysis: What Makes This Resolution Effective

### 1. Strong Preambulatory Section

The preambulatory clauses establish:
- **The problem:** Rising temperatures, natural disasters
- **The need:** Worldwide regulations, collaboration
- **The opportunity:** Advances in renewable energy
- **The gap:** Shortage of climate scientists

### 2. Specific Operative Clauses

Each operative clause includes specific, measurable elements:
- "45% from 2024 levels by 2030"
- "500,000 trees"
- "Nations with GDP above $1 trillion"

### 3. Proper Formatting

- Preambulatory clauses are *italicized* and end with commas
- Operative clauses are **bolded** and end with semicolons
- Sub-clauses use letters (a, b, c) and roman numerals (i, ii, iii)

### 4. Multiple Approaches

The resolution addresses climate change from multiple angles:
- Emissions reduction (Clause 1)
- Renewable energy (Clauses 2, 3, 4)
- Education and research (Clauses 4, 5)
- Waste reduction (Clause 6)

### 5. Funding Mechanisms

The resolution addresses how initiatives will be funded:
- Support from wealthy nations (Clause 2b)
- IMF and UN member donations (Clause 5c)
- Recycling profits (Clause 6d)

### 6. Interconnected Clauses

Later clauses reference earlier ones, creating a cohesive document:
- Clause 6d funds the scholarship program from Clause 5
