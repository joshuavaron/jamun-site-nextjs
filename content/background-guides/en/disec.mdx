## Letter from the Chair

Dear Delegates,

Welcome to the Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) at JAMUN. You're about to debate what may be the single most important issue facing humanity: whether we can prevent nuclear annihilation.

The numbers are stark. Approximately 12,121 nuclear warheads exist today. Major arms control treaties are collapsing. New technologies like hypersonic missiles and AI-driven early warning systems are compressing decision-making timelines from thirty minutes to potentially five. And the "nuclear taboo" that has kept these weapons unused since 1945 is eroding.

Your job is to find solutions. That might mean strengthening existing frameworks like the NPT, creating new verification technologies, or reimagining international security architecture entirely. It will definitely mean navigating the deep divisions between nuclear-armed states, their allies, and the humanitarian abolitionists who believe any possession of these weapons is unconscionable.

The decisions made in rooms like this one shape what leaders believe is possible. Come prepared to think big.

Best regards,

The DISEC Dais

## History of the Committee

The Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC), also known as the First Committee, is the United Nations General Assembly's premier body for addressing global security threats. Established in 1945 alongside the UN itself, DISEC was created with a vital mission: tackling the dangers posed by modern warfare and building a framework for lasting peace.[^1] While other committees focus on social or economic development, DISEC is uniquely charged with managing the "general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security," including the sensitive responsibility of overseeing arms control and promoting global disarmament.[^20]

As a Main Committee of the General Assembly, DISEC holds a level of legitimacy and inclusivity that's rare in international politics. All 193 UN member states have a seat and an equal vote in the committee.[^3] This structure ensures that smaller nations' voices are heard alongside those of major powers. Unlike the Security Council (which has only fifteen members and can issue legally binding orders), DISEC functions as a deliberative body. Its resolutions are non-binding recommendations, but they carry immense political weight by signaling the collective will of the international community and setting the stage for major global treaties.[^14]

The committee's history is deeply connected to the dawn of the nuclear age. The very first resolution ever adopted by the General Assembly in 1946, drafted upon the First Committee's recommendation, focused on the "problems raised by the discovery of atomic energy."[^5] Since then, DISEC has served as the world's most significant forum for debating the balance between national defense and global safety. It's the only committee entitled to verbatim records, meaning every statement made by a delegate is transcribed and preserved as part of the historical record.[^6] This tradition underscores the gravity of the committee's work as it continues to navigate international security in an increasingly technological world.

## Statement of the Problem

The international community faces a nuclear landscape more fractured and volatile than at any point since the height of the Cold War. As of 2025, the global stockpile remains staggering: approximately 12,121 nuclear warheads exist.[^7] Despite decades of high-level diplomacy, the fundamental promise of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (that nuclear-armed states would disarm while others would refrain from building them) is under immense strain.[^17] The modern crisis is defined by a troubling paradox: as technology advances to make these weapons more precise, it simultaneously makes them more "usable" in the eyes of military planners, lowering the threshold for nuclear conflict.[^26]

At the core of this issue lies the erosion of the "nuclear taboo," the long-standing international norm that nuclear weapons should never be used in combat. This taboo is threatened by the development of low-yield tactical weapons and the aggressive nuclear brinkmanship practiced by various world leaders.[^8] The disintegration of major arms control treaties (such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the suspension of the New START treaty) has left the world without a reliable rulebook for managing competition between superpowers. Without these guardrails, the risk of miscalculation or accidental launch has reached critical levels.[^22]

### The Modernization of Nuclear Weapons

The shift from a bipolar Cold War world to a multipolar "Second Nuclear Age" has decentralized nuclear risk. In this new era, security is no longer just about balance between two superpowers; it's a complex web of regional rivalries and technological races. Nearly every nuclear-armed state is currently engaged in an extensive and expensive modernization program.[^25] These programs aren't merely refurbishing old missiles. They're introducing powerful new capabilities that overpower existing systems.

For example, hypersonic delivery vehicles (missiles that travel at more than five times the speed of sound and can maneuver mid-flight) challenge existing missile defense systems.[^4] When a nation can't rely on its defenses to stop an incoming strike, it's incentivized to adopt a "launch-on-warning" posture, where a response must be triggered within minutes of a suspected attack. This creates a security dilemma where every upgrade intended to increase safety actually increases the likelihood of a panicked, catastrophic response from an adversary. In the United States alone, the cost of modernizing the nuclear triad (land, sea, and air capabilities) is projected to reach nearly $2 trillion over the next thirty years, demonstrating the opposite of disarmament.[^5]

### Vertical and Horizontal Proliferation

Proliferation is the dual engine of nuclear instability. **Vertical proliferation** (the enhancement of existing arsenals) is drastically outpacing diplomatic efforts to limit it. Nations are increasingly equipping their missiles with Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to strike several different cities at once.[^6] This "force multiplication" makes it easier for a country to overwhelm an opponent's defenses, further complicating the math of global security.[^10]

At the same time, **horizontal proliferation** (the spread of weapons to new states) threatens to ignite regional arms races. North Korea's continued expansion of its nuclear program, which now includes solid-fuel missiles capable of reaching any point on the globe, drives tension in East Asia.[^7] This development puts pressure on neighboring non-nuclear states like Japan and South Korea, where domestic debates about acquiring their own nuclear deterrents have become increasingly mainstream.[^16]

### Cyber-Nuclear Vulnerabilities

One of the most pressing vulnerabilities in the nuclear enterprise is the susceptibility of command-and-control (C2) systems to cyber-interference. Nuclear weapons are no longer isolated analog systems; they're deeply integrated into global digital networks for communication, satellite targeting, and launch authorization. This integration introduces the risk of "silent" warfare, where a sophisticated cyber-actor could potentially fake a sensor reading to indicate an incoming attack or disable a nation's ability to communicate with its own launch crews.[^3]

The danger is compounded by the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into early-warning systems. While AI can process data faster than any human, it lacks the judgment and context required for nuclear decision-making. In a crisis, an AI-driven system might interpret a routine military exercise or a technical glitch as a high-probability threat, recommending a nuclear strike before human diplomats have even been alerted.[^27] This compression of time (from the thirty minutes of the Cold War era to potentially five minutes in the hypersonic and AI era) means that the fate of the world may soon rest on algorithms prone to errors or "hallucinations."[^33]

### Non-State Actors and Terrorism

While much of DISEC's focus is on state-to-state conflict, a growing concern involves the risk of non-state actors (terrorist organizations or transnational criminal groups) acquiring nuclear or radioactive materials. This is often called the threat of "Nuclear Terrorism." Unlike states, which can be deterred by the threat of retaliation, non-state actors often lack a return address, making traditional deterrence strategies ineffective.[^19]

The problem is rooted in the security of fissile material, the highly enriched uranium or plutonium required to create a nuclear explosion. Hundreds of sites globally currently store these materials, some in regions of political instability.[^12] A "dirty bomb" (a conventional explosive used to scatter radioactive material) wouldn't cause a nuclear explosion, but it would cause mass panic, long-term environmental contamination, and billions of dollars in economic damage. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continues to report hundreds of incidents of illicit trafficking of nuclear materials each year, highlighting a persistent gap in global border security and facility protection.[^13] For delegates, ensuring that not a single gram of fissile material falls into the wrong hands is as critical as dismantling missiles.[^21]

### The Humanitarian Dimension

The committee must also confront the reality that any use of a nuclear weapon would be a global humanitarian catastrophe. The scientific consensus on "Nuclear Winter" suggests that even a limited exchange of 100 small warheads would loft five million tons of soot into the stratosphere.[^14] This smoke would block sunlight, causing global temperatures to drop and leading to a collapse of the global food system. The resulting famine would likely kill far more people than the initial blasts.[^23]

The medical infrastructure of the modern world is fundamentally incapable of responding to a nuclear event. There is no disaster response plan for a city hit by a nuclear weapon; the hospitals, first responders, and communication lines within the blast radius would cease to exist.[^15] This humanitarian reality is the driving force behind the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which seeks to ban these weapons based on their catastrophic humanitarian consequences.[^17] However, since no nuclear-armed state has joined the treaty, the world remains in a state of "unstable luck," relying on the hope that systems will never fail and leaders will never miscalculate.[^9]

## History of the Problem

The history of nuclear weaponry isn't a linear progression toward safety; it's a series of narrow escapes and escalating tensions. From the initial discovery of nuclear fission in 1938 to today's modernization of hypersonic delivery systems, the international community has struggled to reconcile nations' sovereign right to defend themselves with the collective necessity of global survival. This history is defined by a transition from a world that feared a calculated nuclear war to one that now fears an accidental one.[^14]

### The Manhattan Project

The origins of the nuclear problem trace back to the Manhattan Project, a massive, secret research and development effort led by the United States during World War II.[^1] Driven by the fear that Nazi Germany was developing its own atomic bomb, the project brought together the world's leading physicists at Los Alamos, New Mexico. On July 16, 1945, the "Trinity" test marked the first successful detonation of a nuclear device, forever changing international security.[^18]

The subsequent use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 demonstrated the weapon's unparalleled destructive power and established the "atomic age." While these actions arguably ended the war in the Pacific, they also introduced the concept of "dual-use" technology: the same scientific breakthroughs required for nuclear energy could also be used to build weapons of mass destruction.[^25] This dual nature has been the central tension in every DISEC debate since 1946, as the committee seeks to allow nations to benefit from nuclear power while preventing them from weaponizing it.

### The Cuban Missile Crisis

By the early 1960s, the nuclear race had moved beyond the mere possession of bombs to the deployment of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). The world reached its most dangerous point in October 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis.[^4] After the United States discovered Soviet nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba (just 90 miles from Florida), the two superpowers entered a thirteen-day standoff.

This case study is vital for delegates because it highlights the limits of traditional diplomacy. For nearly two weeks, the world teetered on the edge of a thermonuclear exchange that would have killed hundreds of millions.[^5] The crisis was only resolved through secret back-channel negotiations and a naval "quarantine" of Cuba. It proved that even the most rational leaders could find themselves in a situation where the only remaining options are catastrophic. This event led directly to the Hotline between Washington and Moscow, the first major recognition that communication, not just firepower, was essential for nuclear stability.[^6]

### The 1983 Petrov Incident

While the Cuban Missile Crisis represented an intentional standoff, the 1983 Soviet False Alarm incident shows the technological fragility of nuclear systems. On September 26, 1983, Stanislav Petrov, a lieutenant colonel in the Soviet Air Defense Forces, was the duty officer at a command center when the Soviet early-warning system reported five incoming American ICBMs.[^27]

Under Soviet protocol, Petrov was required to report these "strikes" immediately, which would have almost certainly triggered a massive retaliatory launch. But Petrov followed his intuition, reasoning that a real American first strike would involve hundreds of missiles, not just five. He judged the signal to be a computer malfunction caused by sunlight reflecting off clouds.[^8] His decision to remain silent effectively "saved the world," but it revealed a terrifying truth: the global security architecture was, and still is, reliant on the individual judgment of a few people and the accuracy of imperfect sensors.[^19]

### The Goldsboro B-52 Crash

The history of nuclear weapons also includes "Broken Arrows," accidents involving nuclear weapons that don't involve intentional conflict. One of the most significant is the 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash. A B-52 bomber carrying two 3.8-megaton Mark 39 hydrogen bombs broke up mid-air over North Carolina.[^10] As the aircraft disintegrated, the bombs fell toward the farmland below.[^17]

Declassified documents revealed that on one of the bombs, three of the four safety mechanisms failed during the fall. Only a single low-voltage switch prevented a 24-megaton explosion on American soil, an explosion that would have been 260 times more powerful than the Hiroshima blast.[^11] This incident, and others like it in Palomares, Spain, and Thule, Greenland, demonstrated that merely maintaining and transporting nuclear arsenals poses a persistent threat to civilian populations, regardless of the geopolitical climate.[^12]

### Repeated Stalemates

Throughout the 1970s and 80s, the international community attempted to codify disarmament through treaties such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).[^13] These efforts, however, often resulted in repeated stalemates. While the treaties successfully limited the growth of arsenals, they rarely achieved actual disarmament.[^11]

The central problem was the lack of a binding protocol with universal verification. Nations were often unwilling to allow intrusive inspections of their most sensitive military sites, leading to a culture of "trust but verify."[^14] This lack of transparency allowed for the development of MIRV technology, which enabled a single missile to carry multiple warheads, effectively bypassing the numerical limits set by treaties.[^15] For DISEC, this historical trend of treaty evasion highlights the difficulty of creating a disarmament framework that nations actually feel safe enough to follow.[^13]

### The Collapse of the Cold War Order

With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, many believed the nuclear problem had been solved. The Nunn-Lugar Threat Reduction Program successfully helped denuclearize former Soviet states like Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus.[^20] But this peace was short-lived. The 1998 nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, followed by North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT in 2003, signaled the start of a new, more fragmented era of proliferation.[^17]

Today's history is being written by the collapse of the very treaties that kept the Cold War stable. The 2019 withdrawal from the INF Treaty and the recent suspension of New START have returned the world to a state of unregulated competition. The lessons of Hiroshima, the close call in Cuba, and the near-misses in Goldsboro and Petrov's command center suggest that the current path is unsustainable. History shows that in the nuclear age, a single failure of technology or diplomacy isn't just a tragedy; it's potentially the end of civilization as we know it.[^21]

## Past Actions

The United Nations has historically served as the primary architect of the global non-proliferation regime. Since the General Assembly's very first resolution in 1946 (which called for the "elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons"), the committee has sought to create a legal and normative environment where nuclear use is unthinkable.[^19] While DISEC can't command national militaries, its power lies in its ability to draft the frameworks that define international law. The effectiveness of these actions is often limited by state sovereignty, leading to a history defined by monumental breakthroughs followed by deep institutional stagnation.[^21]

### The Non-Proliferation Treaty

The most significant action ever undertaken by the UN on this topic is the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). This treaty is often called a "Grand Bargain" because it rests on three pillars:[^17]

- **Non-proliferation**: Non-nuclear states promise not to acquire nuclear weapons
- **Disarmament**: Nuclear states promise to eventually eliminate their arsenals
- **Peaceful use**: All countries get access to nuclear power for electricity and other civilian purposes

By many measures, the NPT is a resounding success. In the 1960s, experts predicted there would be over 25 nuclear-armed states by the end of the century; today, there are only nine.[^22] The NPT created a global norm that made nuclear possession a mark of international pariah status rather than prestige.

Yet the NPT also represents a significant failure in the eyes of many developing nations. While the non-proliferation pillar has been strictly enforced, the disarmament pillar has largely been ignored by major powers, who continue to modernize their arsenals rather than dismantle them.[^28] This perceived hypocrisy has led to growing polarization within DISEC, as non-nuclear states feel they've held up their end of the bargain while nuclear "haves" have not.[^30] This perceived hypocrisy has led to growing polarization within DISEC.[^6]

### Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones

A cornerstone of UN strategy has been promoting Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones (NWFZs), which represent a "bottom-up" approach to disarmament. Under Article VII of the NPT, groups of states have the right to conclude regional treaties ensuring the total absence of nuclear weapons in their territories.[^18] Today, five major regional treaties cover the entire Southern Hemisphere and parts of the Northern Hemisphere:[^3]

- **Treaty of Tlatelolco** (Latin America)
- **Treaty of Rarotonga** (South Pacific)
- **Treaty of Bangkok** (Southeast Asia)
- **Treaty of Pelindaba** (Africa)
- **Treaty of Semipalatinsk** (Central Asia)

The 1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco is widely considered the gold standard for these agreements. Following the terrifying close call of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Latin American nations acted through the UN to ensure their region would never again be a battleground for nuclear superpowers.[^4] It was the first treaty to cover a densely populated region and included a robust verification body (OPANAL) to monitor compliance.[^26] The success of this model lies in its normative power—it created a legal shield for over 110 countries, effectively removing them from the nuclear arms race.

The global NWFZ project, however, faces a recurring problem: the "Protocol Standoff." For these zones to be truly effective, the five recognized nuclear-weapon states must sign protocols promising to respect the zones and not use nuclear weapons against their members. To date, these states have often attached conditions to their signatures, claiming the right to use nuclear weapons in certain self-defense scenarios—or they've refused to sign altogether due to disputes over territorial waters. This lack of universal recognition weakens the legal protections of these zones, leaving billions of people in "nuclear-free" regions still vulnerable to decisions made in nuclear-armed capitals.[^10]

### The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty

While the NPT and NWFZs represent progress, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) serves as the most prominent example of institutional failure. Adopted by the General Assembly in 1996, the CTBT was designed to ban all nuclear explosions—both civilian and military—in all environments.[^32] By stopping testing, the UN intended to freeze the technological development of new, more dangerous warheads.[^15]

On a technical level, the CTBT has been a success: the UN established the International Monitoring System, a global network of sensors that can detect a nuclear blast anywhere on Earth.[^31] On a legal level, however, the treaty is a failure. For it to enter into force and become binding law, 44 specific countries (those with nuclear technology) must ratify it. To date, eight of these "Annex 2" states (including the United States, China, Iran, and North Korea) have failed to do so.[^32]

Consequently, the CTBT exists in legal limbo. It has created a temporary pause in testing, but because it isn't yet fully binding, countries like Russia have recently threatened to resume testing, which would effectively destroy twenty-five years of diplomatic progress.[^33]

### The International Atomic Energy Agency

The UN has also acted through the creation and empowerment of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). While the IAEA is an independent body, it operates under the UN umbrella and reports directly to the General Assembly and Security Council. The IAEA's "Safeguards" system is the primary tool for verifying that civilian nuclear plants aren't being used to enrich fuel for weapons.[^26]

A key success was the 1997 Additional Protocol, which gave IAEA inspectors the right to conduct short-notice inspections and use advanced environmental sampling to detect hidden nuclear activity.[^35] This is often called the gold standard of verification.

The IAEA's effectiveness, however, depends entirely on the cooperation of the host country. As seen in Iraq in the 1990s and Iran today, if a nation decides to block inspectors or disable monitoring cameras, the IAEA has no enforcement power other than issuing a report to the Security Council.[^13] For delegates in DISEC, this represents a core challenge: how can we strengthen the IAEA's authority without violating member states' sovereign rights?

## Possible Solutions

### Sovereignty-Neutral Verification for Disarmament

A primary obstacle to nuclear disarmament is the "Verification Paradox": nations can't disarm without proof that their rivals are doing the same, but they're often unwilling to allow foreign inspectors to view their most sensitive military secrets.[^39] To resolve this, DISEC could propose a sovereignty-neutral verification protocol. This solution would use emerging technologies like blockchain-based "zero-knowledge proofs" and automated monitoring sensors to verify warhead dismantling without requiring human inspectors to see the weapon's internal design.[^18]

Under this framework, a warhead would be placed into a sealed, automated chamber. Using specialized radiation detectors, the system would confirm the object is a nuclear weapon and then record its destruction on a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger accessible to all UN member states.[^14] Because the data is encrypted and the process automated, nations can prove they're meeting disarmament quotas while protecting their national security secrets. This approach shifts the burden of proof from "trusting a rival" to "trusting the physics of the system," potentially breaking the decades-long stalemate in vertical disarmament talks.[^23]

### Restructuring Security Council Authority

The current international security architecture is often paralyzed by veto deadlock in the UN Security Council, where any one of the five permanent nuclear-armed members (P5) can block action against their own interests.[^43] A bold diplomatic solution involves creating a restructured accountability mechanism that elevates DISEC's authority in matters of nuclear emergency.[^16]

Delegates could propose a resolution allowing a supermajority of the General Assembly (such as two-thirds) to override a Security Council veto specifically on issues related to nuclear proliferation or IAEA safeguards violations.[^44] Additionally, creating a "Nuclear Emergency Council" composed of both nuclear-armed and non-nuclear states could provide an alternative body for managing nuclear crises.[^18] By giving non-nuclear states a binding vote in managing the world's most dangerous weapons, the international community can ensure that humanitarian imperatives are prioritized over the strategic interests of a few. This restructuring would transform the UN from a body that merely monitors nuclear weapons into one that actively regulates them with the authority of the global majority.[^19]

### International Satellite Monitoring Agency

As nuclear delivery systems move toward stealth and hypersonic capabilities, traditional ground-based inspections are no longer sufficient. A comprehensive solution is establishing a UN-managed International Satellite Monitoring Agency (ISMA).[^26] First proposed in the late 1970s but never fully realized, a modern ISMA would operate a constellation of high-resolution, multi-spectral satellites dedicated solely to monitoring nuclear-relevant sites globally.[^29]

Unlike current satellite intelligence, which is owned and kept secret by individual powerful nations, the ISMA would provide "democratized intelligence." The data would be shared in real-time with the IAEA and DISEC, ensuring that no nation can secretly build a silo or move a mobile launcher without the world's knowledge.[^1] By removing the information monopoly held by superpowers, the ISMA would stabilize regional tensions, as neighboring states would no longer rely on rumors or propaganda to assess a rival's nuclear readiness. This "eye in the sky" would serve as a global deterrent against horizontal proliferation and provide the transparency necessary for a world without nuclear weapons.

### Nuclear Famine Prevention Fund

To address the humanitarian impact of a potential nuclear exchange, the UN could establish a Nuclear Famine Prevention Fund (NFPF). This solution approaches nuclear weapons as a global health risk rather than just a military one. The fund would be financed by a "Nuclear Maintenance Tax" levied on states that choose to keep nuclear arsenals, with proceeds used to stockpile global food reserves and develop radiation-resistant agricultural technology.[^7]

This fund would serve two purposes. First, it provides a practical safety net for non-aligned nations who would suffer from Nuclear Winter despite not being part of any conflict. Second, it creates a financial disincentive for nuclear possession. By forcing nuclear states to pay for the global insurance required by their weapons, DISEC can shift the economic math of deterrence. This approach treats nuclear weapons like an environmental pollutant, where the polluter must pay for potential damage—eventually making disarmament the more affordable option for all nations.[^5]

## Potential Blocs

The issue of nuclear weaponry creates a unique and rigid hierarchy within the United Nations, largely defined by the "haves" and "have-nots" of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty. Unlike other DISEC topics where divisions may follow simple regional lines, nuclear diplomacy splits nations based on their perceived security requirements and their willingness to prioritize humanitarian norms over military deterrence. This results in a committee divided into four distinct camps, each with a different vision for global security's future.

### The Nuclear-Armed States (The P5 and Outsiders)

This group includes the major nuclear-armed nations. While these nations often disagree on regional politics, they're united in their belief that nuclear weapons are essential for strategic stability. They generally support the NPT framework because it recognizes their status, but they're almost universally opposed to "radical" solutions like the TPNW. These nations will likely prioritize risk reduction and technical verification over immediate timelines for total disarmament, as they fear that moving too fast could invite conventional war between superpowers.[^2]

### The Umbrella States (Nuclear-Dependent Allies)

A critical middle group in DISEC consists of non-nuclear nations that belong to military alliances with nuclear powers—NATO members being a prime example. These states find themselves in a diplomatic bind: they officially support a nuclear-free world, but their national defense strategies rely on the "nuclear umbrella" of an ally.

In committee, these nations often act as bridge-builders, supporting technical measures and transparency protocols. However, they'll rarely support solutions that delegitimize nuclear deterrence entirely, as doing so would undermine their own security guarantees. They're likely to advocate for sovereignty-neutral verification methods as a way to show progress without breaking their alliance commitments.[^18]

### The Humanitarian Abolitionists (TPNW Advocates)

Composed largely of nations from Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, this bloc views nuclear weapons not as tools of security but as existential threats.[^64] This group was the driving force behind the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). Their position is that any use of nuclear weapons would violate international humanitarian law, regardless of the military necessity claimed by nuclear states.[^6]

In DISEC, this bloc will push for the most transformative solutions, such as the Nuclear Famine Prevention Fund and restructuring of the Security Council. They believe the Grand Bargain of the NPT has failed and seek to pressure nuclear states into disarming through global legal and moral weight.[^24]

### The Developing Modernizers

This final group includes developing nations that may not have a strong opinion on disarmament but are deeply concerned with the NPT's third pillar: the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Countries in this bloc, often found within the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), prioritize access to nuclear technology for medicine, agriculture, and carbon-free electricity.[^7]

They're often wary of over-regulation or intrusive inspections by the IAEA, fearing that strict disarmament protocols could be used as a technological barrier to prevent their economic development. These delegates will support solutions like the NFPF if it provides them with agricultural aid, but they'll resist any measure that limits their sovereign right to develop civilian nuclear power.
