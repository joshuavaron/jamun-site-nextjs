## Letter from the Chair

Dear Delegates,

Welcome to The Haitian Revolution: Liberty or Death, 1791. You are about to participate in one of history's most remarkable, brutal, and consequential uprisings: the only successful large-scale slave revolt in modern history.

It is August 1791. Saint-Domingue is the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean, producing more sugar, coffee, and cotton than any other territory in the world. That wealth is built entirely on the backs of 500,000 enslaved Africans who outnumber the white population nearly ten to one.

Tonight, the enslaved people of the northern plain will rise up. The fires will begin in the cane fields and spread across the colony. Within days, the social order that has existed for over a century will be in flames, both literally and figuratively.

You represent the diverse and often conflicting interests of Saint-Domingue: wealthy plantation owners, free people of color fighting for their rights, revolutionary slaves seeking freedom, and colonial administrators trying to hold everything together. Your personal objectives may put you in alliance with unlikely partners, or in direct conflict with those who share your committee seat.

This is a continuous crisis committee. What you do in the next 72 hours will determine whether a new nation is born, or whether the old order reasserts itself in blood.

Best regards,

The Crisis Dais

## Structure and Mechanics

The Haitian Revolution: Liberty or Death, 1791 is a continuous crisis committee. We know that many delegates may be new to this specialized format, so this section explains how our sessions will be organized and how they'll progress.

As a continuous crisis, every session will use the crisis format rather than standard parliamentary procedure. Crisis committees are split into two distinct areas: the **Front Room** and the **Backroom**. The Front Room is where collaborative work happens—debating, writing directives, and responding to crisis breaks. The Backroom is where you take individual actions through note writing.

Think of crisis as a continuous cycle that repeats throughout the conference. The cycle typically begins with a crisis break, followed by formal debate, the drafting of directives, and voting on those directives. Once these steps are finished, the Crisis Directors and Backroom staff introduce a new crisis update, and the cycle begins again.

In practice, when the first session opens, delegates will face an initial crisis break that introduces the immediate threats facing Saint-Domingue in August 1791. While the first updates will stem from the historical problems detailed in this guide, later updates will be shaped primarily by the secret actions delegates take in the Backroom. Delegates initiate these actions by sending handwritten notes to the Backroom staff.

The committee will work together in the Front Room to address these updates through directives. Think of directives as specific, public action plans meant to solve a particular part of a crisis. To pass a directive, you'll need to use your diplomatic skills: delivering persuasive speeches, engaging in moderated caucuses, and forming alliances during unmoderated caucuses. The Backroom staff monitors all directives passed by the body and will create new crisis breaks that reflect the consequences of your collective decisions.

Every delegate should arrive with a clear vision for their character's personal goals. These objectives should be achievable within the span of the conference and don't necessarily have to match the goals of the committee as a whole. You'll use your private notes to set these personal plans in motion. We strongly recommend that you outline your primary objective in your very first crisis note.

Generally, notes should be written in character and directed to a trusted ally, a family member, or a loyal subordinate. They should contain clear instructions for tasks that help you reach your goal. The more clearly your notes connect to your end goal, the more effectively the Assistant Chairs can help you progress.

In the early sessions, focus on gathering resources and building a foundation for your plans. A helpful strategy is to make sure you have the necessary funding, supplies, hidden locations, and manpower established in your notes before attempting major actions. When requesting resources, always consider the historical reality of 1791. For example, since this committee begins in the 18th century, we won't permit the use of modern technology like telephones or steamships—they simply don't fit the time period.

Your ultimate goal with notes should be to influence the Front Room. The best way to do this is to make sure your Backroom actions are significant enough to trigger a new crisis break for the entire committee to face.

We're excited to see how you use the mechanisms of crisis and your character's resources to shape the future of Haiti. Be creative and bold in your approach to the revolution. Before the conference, we suggest you review typical Model UN terminology and best practices. If you have any questions about these mechanics, please feel free to reach out.

## History of the Problem

### The Pearl of the Antilles

The Haitian Revolution didn't begin in a vacuum. It was the result of over a century of extreme social tension, economic exploitation, and a rigid caste system that made Saint-Domingue both the wealthiest and most unstable colony in the world. To understand why the flames of revolution were lit at Bois Caïman in 1791, we must look back at the very foundation of the French colonial system.[^19]

By the mid-18th century, the French colony of Saint-Domingue (the western third of the island of Hispaniola) had earned the nickname "The Pearl of the Antilles." It was the crown jewel of the French Empire, producing nearly forty percent of the world's sugar and over half of its coffee.[^8]

This immense wealth, however, was built entirely on the backs of an enslaved population that vastly outnumbered their oppressors. The colony operated as a sugar revolution economy, where land was used almost exclusively for cash crops. This created an infrastructure where the colony depended on imported food and resources, making it vulnerable to any disruption in Atlantic trade.

Environmental degradation also played a role. To make room for sugar, millions of trees were felled, leading to soil erosion and more frequent flooding. This made the lives of the enslaved even more difficult, as the small plots of land they were allowed to farm for their own food became less productive.[^16]

### The Code Noir

The social structure of Saint-Domingue was a volatile pyramid. At the top were the **Grand Blancs** (wealthy white planters) and the **Petit Blancs** (poor whites, such as artisans and shopkeepers). Below them were the **Gens de Couleur Libres** (Free People of Color), many of whom were wealthy and educated but were denied basic civil rights. At the bottom, forming nearly ninety percent of the population, were the enslaved Africans.[^13]

To maintain control, the French Crown established the **Code Noir** (Black Code) in 1685. While it technically required masters to provide minimum food and clothing, its primary purpose was to enforce a system of absolute control and dehumanization.[^12] In practice, the code was often ignored by planters who found it more profitable to work the enslaved to death and buy new captives than to provide for their survival.

This constant influx of newly enslaved people from West Africa meant that many in Saint-Domingue still held memories of freedom and traditional African military tactics—knowledge that would later prove vital in the revolution. It also meant the colony was culturally diverse, with Fon, Igbo, and Congolese traditions blending into a new, unique identity. Survival in these conditions required daily resistance.[^10]

### The Maroons and the Legacy of Resistance

Resistance was a constant feature of life in Saint-Domingue long before 1791. Many enslaved individuals escaped into the rugged, mountainous interior of the island, becoming **Maroons**. These fugitives formed independent communities that conducted raids on plantations and maintained secret networks with those still in bondage. These networks were the invisible glue that held the resistance together.[^19]

Perhaps the most famous predecessor to our committee's start date was **François Mackandal**, a Maroon leader and Vodou priest. In the 1750s, Mackandal organized a widespread conspiracy to poison the water supplies and food of white planters. He was eventually captured and executed in 1758—but his legend lived on.

He became a symbol of the "Black Spartacus"—a messianic figure who many believed would one day return to lead the enslaved to total liberation. This legacy of poisoning and psychological warfare established a blueprint for the 1791 uprising.[^29]

### The Gens de Couleur Libres

By the 1780s, the Free People of Color had become an economic powerhouse, owning nearly one-third of the plantation land and many enslaved people themselves. Despite their wealth, they were subjected to increasingly humiliating laws. They were forbidden from wearing certain fabrics, sitting in the same sections of theaters as whites, or holding public office.

This created deep bitterness. Many Gens de Couleur were the children of French planters and had been sent to France for high-level educations. When they returned to Saint-Domingue—only to be treated as second-class citizens—they became the intellectual engines of reform.[^30]

### The French Revolution

The final spark that ignited the powder keg was the French Revolution of 1789.

When the **Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen** was published in Paris, it sent shockwaves through the Caribbean. The document's opening line—"Men are born and remain free and equal in rights"—created a massive legal and moral crisis in the colony. Once spoken, this idea couldn't be taken back.

The Grand Blancs saw the French Revolution as an opportunity to gain independence from French trade restrictions. The Gens de Couleur Libres, however, saw it as a chance to demand the equality they had been denied.[^32]

When their peaceful petitions for rights were met with violence and the public execution of leaders like Vincent Ogé in 1790, the Free People of Color began to arm themselves. This fracturing of the white and free colored elites provided the perfect opening for the enslaved population to organize their own movement, culminating in the secret meeting at Bois Caïman.

The colonial government was paralyzed by these internal divisions. They were so busy fighting each other that they failed to see the massive mobilization happening in the shadows of the northern plantations.[^31]

### The Summer of 1791

In the months leading up to August 1791, a secret intelligence network stretched across the Northern Plain. Leaders like Toussaint Louverture, Boukman Dutty, and Georges Biassou used their roles as carriage drivers and healers—positions that allowed them to travel between plantations—to pass messages. They held secret meetings in caves and forests, known today as the Congrès des Grottes.[^33]

By July, the plan was set. Rumors began to circulate that the French King had already granted freedom to the enslaved, but that the local planters were hiding the law. This rumor was a powerful tool used by organizers to convince thousands that their cause was not only just, but already legal in the eyes of the King.[^28]

On the night of August 14, 1791, everything changed. Under the cover of a massive tropical storm, the leaders gathered at Bois Caïman to swear a blood oath. The revolution was no longer a dream—it was an order. The storm provided perfect cover; the thunder drowned out the sound of gathering voices.[^14]

By the time the sun rose, the most profitable colony in the world was on the brink of total collapse.

## Statement of the Problem

### The Military Disparity

The delegates of the Revolutionary Council face a situation that is as hopeful as it is terrifying. While the oath at Bois Caïman has united thousands, the actual logistics of overthrowing the world's most profitable colonial system are staggering. The problem isn't just a war—it's a total collapse of the old world with no clear map for the new one.

The most immediate and existential threat to the revolution is the sheer power of the French military infrastructure. The French Regulars and the colonial militia aren't just soldiers; they're part of a global superpower equipped with the latest European firearms, heavy cannons, and fortified coastal positions. In contrast, the revolutionary forces are largely armed with machetes, farming tools, and a limited supply of stolen muskets. Many of the insurgents have never seen a cannon in operation, let alone faced a disciplined line of infantry fire.[^35]

The French hold the Grand Forteresse and the city of Le Cap, which serve as nearly impenetrable bases of operation. From these locations, they can launch surgical strikes against rebel camps.

While the rebels have the advantage of numbers and knowledge of the terrain, they lack a centralized command structure. If the different bands of insurgents don't coordinate their attacks, the French will be able to pick them off one by one through superior organization and firepower. One well-placed French battery can hold off a thousand men.[^34]

### The Port Blockade and Reinforcements

Control of the sea is currently entirely in French hands. The French Navy maintains a strict presence in the harbors of Le Cap and Port-au-Prince. This means that at any moment, fresh regiments of battle-hardened soldiers could arrive from Europe to reinforce the colonial government. For the delegates, this creates a ticking clock.[^34]

If the revolution doesn't capture a major port within the first few weeks, they'll be effectively trapped on the island, unable to receive supplies while the French grow stronger every day. The rebels are fighting against a door that is slowly swinging shut.

### The Economic Deadlock

Saint-Domingue's wealth was its sugar. By burning the plantations, the revolutionaries are destroying the very resource that gives the island value. This creates a massive paradox for the committee. To win, you must destroy the French economy, but to survive after winning, you need a functioning economy to buy weapons and food from foreign powers.[^25]

If every mill is reduced to ash, how will the new nation feed itself or trade with the Americans and the Spanish? The delegates must decide how much of the Pearl of the Antilles they're willing to burn to be free. The scorched earth policy is a double-edged sword that could leave the victors in charge of a graveyard.

### The Fragile Alliance

Perhaps the most dangerous problem is the internal tension within this room. The **Gens de Couleur Libres** (Free People of Color) want civil equality and the rights of French citizens. Many of them still own plantations and are hesitant about a total end to the labor system. They want the revolution to stop at legal equality, while others want it to continue to total abolition.[^9]

The **Enslaved Leaders**, meanwhile, will settle for nothing less than the total, immediate abolition of slavery. The **Maroons**, who have lived independently in the mountains for years, often distrust both groups, fearing that any new government will try to force them back into the valleys.

The alliance is a glass vase held together by a single common enemy. If the French offer a compromise to one group—such as granting rights to the Free People of Color but keeping slavery for the rest—the revolution could shatter from within. Betrayal is just as likely a threat as a French musket ball.[^7]

### The Shadow of Foreign Intervention

Saint-Domingue is not an island in a vacuum. To the east lies the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo. To the north lies the young United States, and across the water lies the British colony of Jamaica. Every one of these powers is watching.

The Spanish are willing to provide weapons, but they likely want to reclaim the territory for the Spanish Crown. The British are tempted to intervene to steal the colony from the French, but they're terrified that the contagion of rebellion will spread to their own enslaved populations in Jamaica. Delegates must navigate a world where every ally has a hidden agenda. You're surrounded by empires that would rather see you return to chains than see you succeed as a free, independent republic.[^26]

### The Humanitarian Crisis and Disease

Beyond the politics and the gunpowder, there's the reality of a country at war. As the plantations burn, food supplies are dwindling. Most of the island's food was imported; with the ports under threat and the fields on fire, starvation is a very real possibility for the rebel armies.

Furthermore, disease is a silent player on the battlefield. Yellow fever and malaria are endemic to the Caribbean. While many of the local insurgents have some immunity, a large-scale outbreak could cripple the fighting force just as easily as a French battalion.[^25]

The Statement of the Problem is therefore a question of survival: Can you defeat the most powerful empire on Earth, maintain your fragile alliances, and build a new society—all while the world waits for you to fail? The clock began ticking the moment the ceremony ended. Every minute of indecision in the Front Room is a minute the French use to fortify the ports. The problem is here. The choice is yours.

## Portfolio Powers

The following positions represent the historical figures tasked with navigating the opening stages of the Haitian Revolution. Delegates should use these descriptions to understand their character's motivations and the specific resources they bring to the committee.

### Dutty Boukman

Boukman was an enslaved man of Jamaican origin who became a key spiritual leader in Saint-Domingue. Known for his imposing stature and literacy, he served as a houngan (Vodou priest). In August 1791, he presided over the ceremony at Bois Caïman, where he delivered a famous prayer calling for the rejection of the god of the whites and the embrace of liberty. His primary goal in committee is the immediate destruction of the plantation system through a unified, divinely-inspired uprising.[^24]

As a moral authority for the enslaved masses, he possesses the ability to mobilize thousands of insurgents across the Northern Plain instantly. By utilizing his secret religious networks, he can pass messages that the French cannot intercept, making him the primary strategist for the revolution's initial military surge and the psychological heart of the movement.

### Cécile Fatiman

Cécile Fatiman was a prominent Vodou priestess (mambo) and a free woman of color who played a pivotal role alongside Boukman. At the Bois Caïman ceremony, she performed the sacred rituals that bound the revolutionaries in a blood oath. Her goals center on the spiritual and psychological unity of the movement, ensuring that the diverse groups of enslaved people remain focused on the singular goal of freedom.

Fatiman excels in psychological warfare and holds the power to sway the morale of both friends and enemies. She can boost the courage of revolutionary fighters before a battle or spread terrifying rumors among the French troops that sap their will to fight. She is essential for maintaining the internal resolve of the council during the darkest days of the conflict.[^22]

### Toussaint Louverture

Toussaint Louverture was a former coachman and a self-taught physician who would eventually become the most famous leader of the revolution. In 1791, he was older and more established than many other leaders, having already secured his own freedom. His goal is to transform the chaotic rebel bands into a disciplined, professional army that can stand toe-to-toe with European powers.

He is a master of logistics and long-term stability, utilizing his tactical literacy to intercept and forge French military documents. In the Backroom, Toussaint can organize medical supply lines and set up training camps that improve the combat effectiveness of irregular forces. His unique position as an educated strategist makes him the most intellectually dangerous delegate to the French colonial government, allowing him to outmaneuver the enemy through administrative precision.[^19]

### Georges Biassou

Georges Biassou was one of the highest-ranking generals in the early days of the 1791 uprising. Known for his fiery temper and his command over a massive, aggressive force, he was often at odds with the more cautious Toussaint. Biassou's goal is total victory through absolute destruction; he believes that the only way to ensure the French never return is to leave them with nothing to reclaim.

He wields the power of scorched earth tactics, allowing him to completely dismantle the infrastructure of the Northern Plain. In committee, he can authorize the burning of mills, the destruction of bridges, and the poisoning of French supply caches. While this destroys the colony's wealth, it makes it impossible for the French military to sustain their march into the interior, effectively forcing them back to the coast through starvation and logistical collapse.[^15]

### Jean-François Papillon

Jean-François was a shrewd and ambitious leader who, along with Biassou, commanded the first large-scale rebel armies. He is a pragmatist who understands that a revolution needs more than just bravery—it needs gunpowder and gold. His primary goal is to secure international recognition and supplies for the rebel cause.

Papillon maintains secret diplomatic ties with the Spanish governors in the neighboring colony of Santo Domingo. He specializes in an imperial pivot, which allows him to trade captured French goods for Spanish muskets and ammunition. In the Backroom, he can negotiate safe zones along the border, providing the revolutionaries with a back door for retreats or smuggling operations that the French Navy cannot block.[^4] His ability to navigate international politics makes him the committee's primary link to outside support.

### Jeannot Bullet

Jeannot was one of the most feared leaders of the early insurgency, known for his uncompromising and often brutal tactics against French captives. He believed that the revolution required a reign of terror to break the spirit of the white planters who had oppressed his people for centuries. His goal is the total expulsion or elimination of the French presence on the island by any means necessary.

He specializes in intimidation tactics, using extreme psychological pressure to cause French colonial militias to desert or surrender without a fight. By making the cost of staying in Saint-Domingue too high for the French, he can clear entire districts of the enemy.[^2] While his methods often create tension with the more moderate members of the council, his presence ensures the French never feel secure in their own territory.

### Jean-Jacques Dessalines

Dessalines was a fierce soldier who had survived years of brutal treatment on a plantation, leaving him with deep scars and a deeper hatred for the French. He is a man of action who believes that "liberty or death" is the only choice. His goal is the absolute military defeat of the French through relentless offensive maneuvers.

Dessalines is a master of guerrilla warfare in difficult terrain, often leading his troops through supposedly impassable jungles and mountain passes to strike the French where they're most vulnerable. He can bypass traditional battlefield rules, launching night raids and ambushes that keep the French military in a state of constant, exhausted alarm.[^8] His relentless offense ensures that the revolution remains on the move, never giving the colonial forces time to regroup or fortify their positions.

### Halaou

Halaou was a charismatic Maroon leader from the West Province who led a large, independent following. He was known for carrying a white rooster, which his followers believed protected them from bullets. His goal is the preservation of Maroon independence and the expansion of the rebellion into the western parts of the island.

Halaou's unique standing as a mystic and a warrior makes him a powerful recruiter. Through the use of the Great Chant, he can sway neutral enslaved populations or unaligned Maroon bands to join the central council's cause. He is essential for expanding the revolution's geographic reach, bringing in thousands of new fighters who are experts in surviving and fighting in the rugged wilderness, effectively stretching French military resources thin across the island.[^12]

### Hyacinthe Ducas

Hyacinthe was a young, influential Maroon leader who gained fame for leading thousands of rebels in the War of the South. He was famous for his bravery, often leading his men into battle while carrying only a wooden fan, which he claimed could deflect French cannonballs. His goal is to prove that the revolutionary spirit is stronger than European technology.

His mastery of the forest allows his forces to remain undetected by French scouts. In committee, he can move large bodies of troops through the island's forests without triggering a crisis update, allowing him to position his men for massive, coordinated ambushes.[^20] This ability to manipulate the fog of war makes him a terrifying opponent for any French officer attempting to navigate the interior of Saint-Domingue.

### Romaine-la-Prophétesse

Romaine-la-Prophétesse was a free person of color who claimed to be a prophetess in direct communication with the Virgin Mary. Leading a large force of both enslaved and free people, Romaine occupied several towns and plantations in the South. Their goal is to establish a new social order based on their religious visions, often challenging both the French and the other rebel leaders.

Romaine holds a unique divine mandate, which allows them to influence the Petit Blancs (poor whites) and neutral parties. By claiming a higher spiritual authority, Romaine can cause political confusion in the French ranks and even convince some colonial officials to stall their attacks.[^11] This religious authority provides a layer of political protection that makes Romaine a highly unpredictable and influential force in the region.

### André Rigaud

André Rigaud was a wealthy and educated free man of color who had served in the French military during the American Revolution. He is a disciplined professional soldier who believes in the Enlightenment ideals of liberty, but he also values order and property. His goal is to secure full civil rights for the Gens de Couleur while maintaining a stable, functioning society.

As a commander of the Savannah Volunteers, he leads a highly trained militia that is far more disciplined than the insurgent bands. In the Front Room, Rigaud is a voice of military reason, while in the Backroom, he can deploy his Legion of the South to hold key strategic points against French incursions.[^21] His ability to bring professional military standards to the revolution is vital for its long-term survival.

### Alexandre Pétion

Alexandre Pétion was a skilled engineer and artillery officer who studied at the military academy in Paris. He is a brilliant intellectual who believes in republican government and the rule of law. His goal is to modernize the revolutionary forces and build the technical infrastructure necessary for a new state.

As a ballistics expert, he is vital for the revolution's success against fortified French positions. He can oversee the repair of captured cannons and the construction of defensive earthworks.[^15] In the Backroom, he can design fortifications that turn simple rebel camps into formidable bastions, making it nearly impossible for the French to reclaim territory once Pétion has fortified it. His technical knowledge bridges the gap between a disorganized uprising and a professional war of independence.

### Julien Raimond

Julien Raimond was the most prominent advocate for the rights of the Gens de Couleur in Paris. A wealthy indigo planter, he spent years lobbying the French National Assembly to live up to the promise of the Declaration of the Rights of Man. His goal is to achieve legal equality through diplomacy and legislation rather than total war.

Through his Parisian advocacy, he can influence the government back in France from afar. He can use his influence to trigger Legislative Decrees from the National Assembly that grant rights or change colonial laws, creating legal chaos for the French planters in Saint-Domingue.[^13] This forces the colonial governors to choose between following Paris or protecting their own power, effectively destabilizing the enemy's political foundation without firing a shot.

### Jean-Baptiste Chavannes

Chavannes was a veteran of the Siege of Savannah and a close ally of the martyr Vincent Ogé. He is a radical who believes that the time for petitioning the French is over and the time for fighting has begun. His goal is the total removal of the white planter class from power in Saint-Domingue.

Having fought in the American Revolution, Chavannes is a siege specialist who can identify the structural weaknesses in French coastal forts and naval batteries.[^6] In committee, he can coordinate complex attacks on port cities, allowing the revolutionaries to capture the very docks that the French depend on for reinforcements and supplies. His strategic understanding of urban and naval warfare is essential for breaking the French grip on the colony's coastline.

### Jean-Pierre Lambert

Lambert was a powerful leader of the free colored militia in the South and a wealthy landowner. He represents the interests of the established Free People of Color who want to protect the island's wealth while achieving political power. His goal is to find a middle ground where the Gens de Couleur can lead the colony into a new era of prosperity without the interference of the French Crown.

Through militia mobilization, he can rapidly raise funds and well-equipped troops from the southern estates. He acts as the committee's primary banker and recruiter, able to provide the financial resources and professional equipment necessary to keep the revolution's gears turning. His access to private wealth and established networks of power makes him indispensable for funding the war effort.[^7]

### Léger-Félicité Sonthonax

Sonthonax was a radical Jacobin sent by the French revolutionary government to enforce the new laws of equality in the colony. He is a true believer in the Republic but is increasingly aware that the only way to save French control is to side with the enslaved. His goal is to preserve the island for the French Republic by any means necessary, even if it means ending slavery.

Through his power of civil proclamation, he can issue official legal decrees that have the weight of the French state. He can offer Freedom for Service, legally manumitting thousands of fighters and turning them into official soldiers of the Republic.[^9] This legal authority can drastically shift the balance of power, forcing the council to deal with the complexities of French law.

### Colonel Pierre-Agathe Cambefort

Cambefort was a high-ranking French officer of the Regiment du Cap who eventually grew disillusioned with the cruelty of the planter class and the chaos of the colonial administration. He possesses deep knowledge of the very military machine the revolutionaries are fighting. His goal is a peaceful resolution that prevents the total destruction of the island he has come to call home.

He provides vital military intelligence to the council, including detailed maps of French supply lines, troop rotations, and the exact locations of gunpowder magazines. By sharing this information, he allows the revolutionaries to strike with surgical precision, avoiding the most heavily defended French traps. His presence in the committee represents the internal fractures within the French military hierarchy.[^29]

### Jacques-Pierre Brissot

Brissot was the founder of the Société des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks) in Paris. While he is not on the island, his influence is massive. His goal is the gradual abolition of slavery and the spread of revolutionary ideals throughout the French Empire.

Through the abolitionist press, he can influence public opinion in Europe. By publishing accounts of French atrocities in Saint-Domingue, he can cause a public outcry in Paris that leads to a cut-off in funding for the colonial army or the recall of particularly brutal French generals. He acts as the revolution's voice in the halls of power, ensuring the world is watching and creating international pressure that the colonial government cannot ignore.[^19]

### Thomas Clarkson

Thomas Clarkson was a leading British abolitionist who dedicated his life to ending the Atlantic slave trade. He represents the international wing of the abolitionist movement. His goal is to see the Haitian Revolution succeed as a shining example that will lead to the global end of slavery.

Through naval smuggling, he can arrange for British merchant ships to "lose" crates of weapons and medicine near rebel-controlled shores. He can also use his influence to ensure that British naval patrols look the other way while the revolutionaries move supplies between islands. This provides the council with a vital lifeline that the French Navy cannot easily cut, making the revolution a truly international effort supported by the global abolitionist network.[^23]

### Etienne Laveaux

Etienne Laveaux was a French aristocrat and professional soldier who embraced the radical egalitarianism of the French Revolution. He eventually became a close friend and ally of Toussaint Louverture. His goal is to bridge the gap between the French Republic and the Black revolutionaries to create a new, equal society.

Through a republican alliance, he can communicate with French regular soldiers who may be sympathetic to the revolution's ideals. He can trigger mass desertions or even mutinies of conscience, where French units refuse to fire on the revolutionaries, believing that they are all fighting for the same liberty, equality, and fraternity. His ability to flip the loyalties of the rank-and-file French soldier is a unique and powerful tool for the council.[^30]
