## Letter from the Chair

Dear Delegates,

Welcome to Rwanda 1994: The RPF's Stand. You are about to step into one of the darkest moments of the 20th century, and one of its most urgent moral tests.

It is April 1994. Last night, President Habyarimana's plane was shot down over Kigali. Within hours, the killing began. Roadblocks are going up across the country. The radio is broadcasting lists of names. And the international community, which promised "never again" after the Holocaust, is looking away.

You are the high command of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, a rebel army that has been fighting for the right of Tutsi refugees to return home for nearly four years. You have roughly 14,000 troops scattered across the north and in Kigali under the terms of a peace agreement that is now being written in blood. The government army and the Interahamwe militias have begun systematically murdering Tutsi civilians, and there is no one else coming to stop them.

Your decisions over the next hundred days will determine how many people die, whether the genocide succeeds or fails, and what kind of country emerges from the ashes. This is not a simulation of diplomacy. This is a simulation of survival.

Best regards,

The Crisis Dais

## Structure and Mechanics

Rwanda 1994: The RPF's Stand is a continuous crisis committee. We know that you may not have experience with this specific format, so this section will explain the general structure and flow of committee to help all delegates participate effectively.

As mentioned, this committee uses the crisis format for all sessions. Crisis committees can be divided into two distinct parts: the **front room** and the **back room**. In the front room, crisis committees feature mechanics like directive writing and crisis breaks. The back room is where note writing takes place.

### The Crisis Cycle

Crisis operates on a cycle that repeats throughout the conference:

1. **Crisis break** — The dais presents a new development or problem
2. **Debate** — Delegates discuss the crisis
3. **Directive writing** — Delegates draft solutions
4. **Directive voting** — The committee votes on proposed directives
5. *Repeat*

When the first session begins, delegates will face an initial crisis break introducing the committee's starting problems—such as the immediate fallout from the political assassinations in Kigali. Early crises will focus on issues discussed in this background guide. As the conference progresses, crisis breaks will increasingly be driven by delegates' backroom actions through their notes.

### Directives

Delegates work together to solve crises through **directives**. Think of directives as targeted solutions for different aspects of the crisis being presented—for example, mobilizing a medical convoy or coordinating a localized defense. Passing directives requires skills like giving speeches, debating during moderated caucuses, and working with other delegates in blocs during unmoderated caucuses. The backroom staff monitors all directives as they're presented and designs crisis breaks that respond to what delegates pass.

### Backroom Notes

Come prepared with an idea for your character's personal goal for the committee. These goals should ideally be achievable within five committee sessions and don't have to align with the committee's overall objectives. You'll use notes to put these goals into motion. We strongly encourage you to include your goals in your first crisis note.

Notes should be written in character and directed to a subordinate, an ally in the field, or a contact in the diaspora. They should contain instructions for specific tasks that benefit your goal. The clearer the connection to your end goal, the easier it will be for Assistant Chairs (the people reading and responding to your notes) to help you.

### Building Your Foundation

In the beginning, focus on accumulating resources and laying the groundwork for your character's goals. A good rule of thumb: establish your finances, infrastructure, communication networks, and manpower before executing major actions.

When requesting resources, consider the historical context. Since this committee takes place in 1994, we won't grant modern satellite-tracking technology or social media—that wouldn't be realistic for the time period.

Your goal with notes should be to trigger front room crisis breaks as often as possible. The best way to do this is to make your backroom actions disruptive or impactful enough to affect the entire committee.

We look forward to seeing how you navigate these mechanisms and use all the resources at your disposal. Think creatively about how you approach the problems you'll face. Before the conference, we encourage you to visit the MUNUC website to familiarize yourself with typical terminology and best practices. If anything is unclear, don't hesitate to reach out.

## History of the Problem

### The Shadow of Colonialism

Long before the first shots of the 1990 Civil War, the roots of the Rwandan conflict were planted by European imperialism. In the pre-colonial era, the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was more about social class and occupation than rigid ethnicity. Tutsis were often cattle-owners and elites, while Hutus were typically farmers.[^22] Movement between these groups was possible, and they shared the same language (Kinyarwanda) and religious beliefs.

When Germany and later Belgium took control of Rwanda in the early 20th century, they applied racial theories to the population. The Belgian administration believed the Tutsi minority was racially superior to the Hutu majority because they supposedly looked more European. To solidify this hierarchy, the Belgians introduced mandatory ethnic identity cards in 1933. This turned a fluid social class system into a rigid, inescapable racial classification. Tutsis received the best jobs and educational opportunities, while Hutus were relegated to forced labor.[^24]

This decades-long favoritism created deep, simmering resentment among the Hutu majority, who began to view the Tutsis not as neighbors, but as foreign oppressors. By the time the Europeans prepared to leave, Rwanda's social fabric was already badly damaged.

### The 1959 Revolution

By the late 1950s, decolonization was sweeping across Africa. In Rwanda, the Belgian authorities—noticing that Tutsis were beginning to demand independence—abruptly switched their support to the Hutu majority. They realized that a Hutu-led government would be more dependent on Belgian aid.

In 1959, a Hutu uprising known as the Social Revolution broke out. Violence against Tutsis was widespread—houses were burned and thousands were killed as the centuries-old Tutsi monarchy was overthrown.[^25]

When Rwanda gained independence in 1962, the new Hutu-led government established a system that mirrored the colonial oppression they had just escaped—only now, the Tutsis were the ones being excluded. Over the next decade, hundreds of thousands of Tutsis fled to neighboring countries like Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania. These refugees were often denied the right to return home, creating a massive, stateless population of exiles who dreamed of reclaiming their place in Rwanda.[^21]

In the eyes of the new Republic, these Tutsis were no longer citizens. They were labeled *inyenzi* ("cockroaches"), supposedly waiting for the right moment to return and seize power.

### The Economic Collapse

While ethnic tensions were the primary driver of conflict, the late 1980s brought an economic catastrophe that pushed Rwandans to a breaking point. Rwanda's economy depended almost entirely on coffee exports—but in 1989, international coffee prices plummeted. Simultaneously, a severe drought struck the southern regions, leading to widespread famine and desperation.[^17]

The government, led by President Habyarimana, was forced to accept a harsh Structural Adjustment Program from the World Bank, which led to the devaluation of the Rwandan franc and massive cuts to social services.

As quality of life collapsed for average Rwandan farmers, the Hutu-led government needed a scapegoat. They pointed to the Tutsis—both within the country and the exiles in Uganda—as the reason for the nation's poverty. By framing the RPF's eventual invasion as a foreign plot to take land and cattle from Hutu farmers, the government successfully channeled economic frustration into genocidal ideology. The Hutu Power movement gained followers not just through hatred, but through the promise that killing Tutsis would lead to the redistribution of their wealth and land to the poor.[^15]

### The Rise of the RPF

The children of the 1959 refugees grew up in Uganda's camps. Many were well-educated and became battle-hardened soldiers while fighting in the Ugandan Bush War alongside Yoweri Museveni. In 1987, they formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) with two main goals: the right of return for all refugees and the end of the ethnic quota system in Rwanda. They believed military action was the only way to force the Rwandan government to acknowledge their rights.[^11]

On October 1, 1990, the RPF's military wing, the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), launched a surprise invasion from Uganda into northern Rwanda. Led initially by Fred Rwigyema (who died in the first days of the invasion) and later by Paul Kagame, the RPF sought to force the Rwandan government to the negotiating table. This invasion sparked the Rwandan Civil War.

The government, led by President Juvénal Habyarimana, responded by portraying the RPF as feudal invaders who wanted to enslave the Hutus, using state media to spread fear and hatred.[^5] The war reached a stalemate as French and Zairian troops arrived to support the Rwandan government army (FAR). The RPF retreated into the Virunga Mountains, where they transformed into a disciplined guerrilla force.

### The Hutu Power Movement

As the civil war continued, a radical ideology known as Hutu Power began consuming the capital. This wasn't just a political movement—it was a psychological campaign designed to convince ordinary Hutus that their Tutsi neighbors were a mortal threat.

In 1990, the *Hutu Ten Commandments* were published in the newspaper *Kangura*, declaring that any Hutu who married, befriended, or did business with a Tutsi was a traitor.[^8] This document laid the moral groundwork for the coming violence by dehumanizing the Tutsi population.

The most dangerous weapon in this campaign was Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM). Because literacy rates were low, radio was the primary information source for most Rwandans. RTLM used a casual, conversational tone, playing popular music mixed with jokes and horrifying calls to violence. They told listeners that the RPF was coming to kill them all, and that the only way for a Hutu to survive was to strike first. This constant hate speech turned peaceful villages into potential battlegrounds.[^4]

Alongside the media campaign, the government armed and trained the **Interahamwe** ("Those who work together"), a paramilitary youth militia. These young men received uniforms, machetes, and a sense of purpose. They were told that "work" meant killing Tutsis. By 1994, the government had distributed enough machetes to arm a significant portion of the population, turning political conflict into a nationwide conspiracy for mass violence.[^13]

### Echoes of the Cold War

The Rwandan conflict was heavily influenced by post-Cold War power dynamics. For decades, France had maintained a close relationship with the Habyarimana regime as part of its *Françafrique* policy, which sought to preserve French influence in French-speaking African nations. France viewed the RPF as an Anglophone threat, primarily because many RPF leaders had been educated in English-speaking Uganda. As a result, the French government provided the FAR with sophisticated weaponry, training, and tactical advice, effectively keeping the Hutu-led government in power.[^16]

Meanwhile, the United States and United Kingdom were hesitant to get involved in another African conflict following the disastrous Black Hawk Down incident in Somalia in 1993. This led to extreme caution within the United Nations. When the Arusha Accords were signed, the UN sent a severely underfunded and under-equipped peacekeeping force (UNAMIR) that was never intended to stop a full-scale genocide.

The RPF leaders knew they were fighting not just a local militia, but a regime backed by a world power, while the rest of the world watched with indifference.[^12]

### The Arusha Accords

International pressure eventually forced both sides to sign the Arusha Accords in 1993. This peace treaty was supposed to end the war by creating a power-sharing government, integrating RPF soldiers into the national army, and allowing refugees to return. For a brief moment, peace seemed possible, and a small UN peacekeeping force (UNAMIR) was sent to monitor the transition.[^6]

However, Hutu extremists within Habyarimana's inner circle, known as the *Akazu*, saw the Arusha Accords as a betrayal. They began preparing for a "final solution" to the Tutsi problem. Every time a compromise was reached, the extremists orchestrated riots or localized massacres to sabotage the deal.

By early 1994, the RPF had a battalion stationed in Kigali as part of the treaty, but they were surrounded by hostile government forces in a city on the brink of collapse.[^1]

## Statement of the Problem

### The Assassination of the State

The morning of April 7, 1994, brought not sunlight to Kigali but smoke from a burning capital. Following the downing of President Habyarimana's plane the previous night, Hutu Power extremists moved with speed that suggested months of rehearsal, turning the city's quiet streets into a scene of coordinated chaos. By dawn, Rwanda's constitutional order was effectively dead.[^4]

The Presidential Guard, alongside Interahamwe militias, had begun a systematic purge of the government's moderate wing, blocking every major road with improvised checkpoints.

Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana—the person legally recognized to take control in a crisis—was tracked down and assassinated by government forces despite UN peacekeepers nearby.[^10] With her death, the last legal bridge to the Arusha Accords was destroyed, leaving the country in the hands of a self-appointed Crisis Committee of military hardliners with no intention of sharing power.

This political decapitation has left the RPF in an impossible position. Without a recognized head of state to coordinate with, the RPF is no longer just a rebel group fighting for refugee rights—they are now the only organized force standing between the civilian population and state-sponsored slaughter.

Delegates must grapple with this reality: the government they were supposed to join in a power-sharing agreement is now the primary architect of a genocide. Every minute spent debating the legality of the Arusha Accords is a minute the Interahamwe uses to tighten their grip.[^20]

### A Nation of Roadblocks

The problem facing delegates is not a traditional frontline war but a decentralized, nationwide massacre happening in every village and on every street corner. The Interim Government has turned the state's infrastructure into a machine for killing. Local officials have been ordered to mobilize "work details," and RTLM radio broadcasts the names and addresses of Tutsi families and "moderate Hutu traitors" with terrifying precision.[^16]

This creates a logistical nightmare for RPF military command. If the RPA launches a standard invasion from the north, they may win territory, but by the time they arrive, there may be no one left to save. The conflict is no longer about capturing hills or barracks—it's about disrupting a social collapse that has turned neighbors against one another.[^13]

Communication has become a weapon. While extremists use radio to coordinate militias, the RPF and its allies struggle to maintain a coherent message. Moderate resistance members within Kigali are hiding in attics and church basements, their phone lines cut and movements tracked.[^3]

For political delegates, the challenge is visibility and legitimacy. They must find a way to project authority and safety to a terrified population while their own colleagues are being executed. The social fabric isn't just tearing—it's being intentionally shredded to ensure that Hutus and Tutsis can never live together in peace again.[^6]

### The Command and Control Crisis

For the RPF High Command, the most pressing issue is the breakdown of reliable information. In the fog of war, it's nearly impossible to tell which units of the regular Rwandan army (FAR) are participating in the genocide and which might be open to defection. The RPA is a disciplined force, but it's currently split between main camps in the north and small, isolated pockets of resistance in the south and capital.[^5]

Moving troops through the country means navigating a landscape where every hilltop is a potential ambush and every valley holds civilians who may be armed and hostile.

The Crisis Committee has seized control of national telephone and telegraph networks. This means the RPF must rely on slow, insecure radio transmissions or physical messengers to coordinate movements. If a field commander makes a mistake, central leadership has no way to correct it in real-time.

Delegates must determine how to maintain military discipline and strategic focus when their officers are witnessing unspeakable horrors that tempt them to abandon orders for immediate, localized revenge.[^9]

### The Fractured Resistance and the Refugee Crisis

As the RPF prepares to move, a new challenge emerges: the breakdown of the multi-ethnic coalition. While the RPF is largely Tutsi-led, its survival depended on support from Hutu moderates who believed in a unified Rwanda. With those leaders being systematically hunted, the middle ground is vanishing.[^16]

The RPF must decide how to integrate Hutu defectors and fleeing civilians without compromising security. Every person seeking refuge could be a survivor—or an infiltrator sent by the Crisis Committee.[^19]

Beyond political fragmentation, a massive humanitarian wave is building. Hundreds of thousands of people are moving toward the borders of Uganda, Tanzania, and Zaire. These people aren't just fleeing fighting—they're fleeing a total collapse of food and water supplies.[^26] The RPF currently lacks the resources to act as both a liberating army and a humanitarian aid agency.

If delegates focus purely on military victory, they risk presiding over a graveyard. If they focus on humanitarian relief, they may lose the strategic momentum needed to defeat government forces.[^27]

### The Silence of the Blue Helmets

International abandonment has become cold reality. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) is effectively a ghost force. Following the murder of ten Belgian peacekeepers who attempted to protect the Prime Minister, Western powers are moving toward total withdrawal.[^25]

Delegates must operate under the assumption that the international community will not intervene to stop the killing. Many foreign nations are actively prioritizing the evacuation of their own expatriates and embassy staff, often leaving Rwandan employees behind to face the militias.[^24]

This isolation complicates every aspect of the RPF's mission. Without international logistical support, the RPF must secure its own supply lines for food, medicine, and ammunition. They must also manage the refugee wave while fighting a government that possesses superior heavy weaponry and air support.

The delegates face the weight of being the sole protectors of a nation—a professional army, a radicalized civilian militia, and a world that has decided to look away, all at the same time.[^22]

### The Interim Government

As the killing spreads, the extremist-formed Interim Government works tirelessly to gain international recognition as the true representatives of the Rwandan people. They use remaining diplomatic channels to claim the violence is merely "spontaneous civil unrest" caused by RPF aggression.[^20]

For RPF diplomats, the challenge is proving to the world that what's happening is state-orchestrated genocide, not a simple civil war. If they fail to win public opinion, the RPF could face sanctions or even attack from foreign powers who believe they're interfering in Rwanda's internal affairs.

The RPF must act as a government-in-exile, providing a clear moral alternative to the madness in Kigali. This requires drafting legal frameworks for a post-conflict Rwanda even while the conflict rages. They must convince the international community—and the Hutu majority—that they are liberators who will bring justice, not conquerors who will bring their own ethnic cleansing.

The legitimacy gap is a void that extremists are happy to fill with lies. Closing it may be the most difficult task delegates face.[^12]

The RPF now stands at the edge of a total war they didn't choose but cannot ignore. They face a military challenge in the northern mountains, a political crisis in the halls of power, and a humanitarian catastrophe in the valleys. The choices made by this committee will determine if Rwanda emerges as a unified nation or disappears into a cycle of permanent vengeance.

The state has been weaponized, the peace has been buried, and the only path forward is through the heart of the storm.[^1]
