Resolutions are the primary output of Model UN committees. They represent the committee's official position on an issue and propose concrete actions to address it. Learning to write effective resolutions is one of the most important skills you can develop in MUN—strong resolutions demonstrate leadership, attract coalition partners, and increase your chances of winning awards.

This guide covers everything from basic structure to advanced techniques for writing resolutions that pass and make an impact.

## What Is a Resolution?

A resolution is a formal document adopted by a UN committee that expresses the committee's position and recommends actions on a particular issue. In Model UN, resolutions are the tangible result of all your debate, negotiation, and collaboration.

### Key Characteristics

**(a)** Resolutions are written as a single continuous sentence, broken into clauses separated by commas and semicolons.

**(b)** They have a specific structure: header, preambulatory clauses, and operative clauses.

**(c)** They require sponsors (authors) and signatories (supporters) before being brought to the floor.

**(d)** Once passed, they represent the official position of the committee.

## Resolution Structure

Every resolution follows the same basic structure. Understanding this structure is essential for writing effective documents.

### Header

The header identifies the resolution and includes:

**(a)** **Committee name**: The full name of the committee (e.g., "United Nations General Assembly")

**(b)** **Topic**: The issue being addressed

**(c)** **Sponsors**: The main authors of the resolution (maximum 5% of committee, rounded up)

**(d)** **Signatories**: Delegates who want to see it debated (minimum 20% of committee, rounded down)

**(e)** **Resolution title**: An optional creative name or acronym

### Preambulatory Clauses

Preambulatory clauses set the context for your resolution. They explain why the issue matters and what background the committee should consider.

#### Purpose of Preambulatory Clauses

**(a)** Reference relevant past UN actions, treaties, and resolutions

**(b)** State important facts about the situation

**(c)** Acknowledge the scope and severity of the problem

**(d)** Establish the legal and historical foundation for action

**(e)** Express the committee's concern or appreciation regarding the issue

#### Format

**(a)** Each clause begins with an *italicized* present participle (a verb ending in -ing)

**(b)** Each clause ends with a comma

**(c)** Clauses are not numbered

#### Common Preambulatory Phrases

| Phrase | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| *Acknowledging* | Recognizing a fact or situation |
| *Affirming* | Confirming a principle or commitment |
| *Alarmed by* | Expressing concern about a serious situation |

| *Recalling* | Referencing past resolutions or treaties |
| *Taking into account* | Considering relevant factors |
| *Welcoming* | Expressing approval of developments |

### Operative Clauses

Operative clauses are the action items—what the committee actually wants to happen. These are the heart of your resolution.

#### Purpose of Operative Clauses

**(a)** Propose specific actions to address the problem

**(b)** Establish mechanisms, programs, or bodies

**(c)** Request actions from member states, the Secretary-General, or other UN entities

**(d)** Set timelines and accountability measures

#### Format

**(a)** Each clause begins with a **bolded** or *underlined* present-tense verb (third person singular)

**(b)** Clauses are numbered (1, 2, 3...)

**(c)** Sub-clauses use letters (a, b, c...) and then roman numerals (i, ii, iii...)

**(d)** Each clause ends with a semicolon, except the final clause which ends with a period

#### Common Operative Phrases

| Phrase | Strength | When to Use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| *Calls upon* | Strong | Urging specific action from states |
| *Decides* | Strongest | Making definitive committee decisions |
| *Demands* | Very strong | Urgent or critical situations |
| *Encourages* | Moderate | Suggesting voluntary action |

| *Supports* | Moderate | Backing existing efforts |
| *Urges* | Strong | Pressing for important action |

## Writing Effective Clauses

The quality of your clauses determines the quality of your resolution. Here's how to write clauses that are compelling and effective.

### Preambulatory Clause Tips

**(a)** Reference specific UN resolutions by number when possible (e.g., "Recalling General Assembly Resolution 66/288...")

**(b)** Include relevant statistics to establish the scope of the problem

**(c)** Acknowledge what has already been done to show you understand the context

**(d)** Keep preambulatory sections concise—the focus should be on operative clauses

**(e)** Arrange clauses in a logical order (historical context → current situation → expression of concern)

### Operative Clause Tips

**(a)** **Be specific**: "Requests member states to contribute $50 million annually to the Green Climate Fund" is better than "Requests increased funding."

**(b)** **Be actionable**: Every operative clause should propose something that can actually be done.

**(c)** **Be realistic**: Propose actions within the UN's actual capabilities and authority.

**(d)** **Consider implementation**: Who will do this? How? When? What resources are needed?

**(e)** **Address funding**: Strong resolutions explain how proposals will be financed.

**(f)** **Include accountability**: How will success be measured? Who reports on progress?

### Using Sub-Clauses

Sub-clauses break down complex proposals into manageable parts:

**(a)** Use sub-clauses to provide details, examples, or implementation steps

**(b)** First level: lowercase letters (a, b, c)

**(c)** Second level: roman numerals (i, ii, iii)

**(d)** Don't go deeper than two levels of nesting—it becomes hard to follow

## Building Coalitions for Your Resolution

A resolution needs support to pass. Building a coalition is as important as writing the document itself.

### Finding Partners

**(a)** **Identify like-minded countries**: Look for delegates whose countries share your position or interests.

**(b)** **Consider regional blocs**: Countries from the same region often vote together.

**(c)** **Look for complementary interests**: Even countries with different priorities may support your resolution if it includes something for them.

### Gathering Sponsors and Signatories

**(a)** **Sponsors** are the main authors. Choose active, influential delegates who will help present and defend the resolution.

**(b)** **Signatories** just want to see it debated—they don't have to vote for it. Cast a wider net here.

**(c)** Approach potential supporters during unmoderated caucuses with a clear pitch.

**(d)** Be willing to incorporate others' ideas to gain their support.

### Merging Resolutions

**(a)** If multiple blocs have similar resolutions, consider merging them for stronger support.

**(b)** Identify the best clauses from each resolution.

**(c)** Negotiate which ideas make it into the final merged document.

**(d)** Ensure all merging parties become sponsors.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Watch out for these common resolution-writing errors:

### Vague Language

**(a)** Avoid phrases like "take appropriate action" or "address the issue."

**(b)** Specify exactly what should happen, who should do it, and when.

**(c)** If you can't explain specifically what a clause does, it shouldn't be in the resolution.

### Unrealistic Proposals

**(a)** Don't propose actions the UN can't actually take (e.g., forcing countries to do things against their will).

**(b)** Remember that most UN bodies can only recommend, not mandate.

**(c)** Consider practical constraints like funding, political feasibility, and sovereignty.

### Ignoring Funding

**(a)** Strong resolutions address how proposals will be financed.

**(b)** Identify funding sources: existing UN budgets, voluntary contributions, new mechanisms.

**(c)** Be realistic about what member states will actually fund.

### Poor Organization

**(a)** Group related clauses together logically.

**(b)** Build from foundational clauses to more specific ones.

**(c)** Ensure operative clauses connect to the concerns raised in preambulatory clauses.

### Formatting Errors

**(a)** Preambulatory clauses: italicized opening phrase, end with comma

**(b)** Operative clauses: bolded/underlined opening phrase, end with semicolon (period for last clause)

**(c)** Number operative clauses; don't number preambulatory clauses

## Resolution Writing Process

Follow this process for efficient resolution writing:

### Step 1: Identify Key Issues

**(b)** Consider solutions from different angles (economic, political, humanitarian, etc.).

**(c)** Think about what other countries would support.

### Step 3: Draft Operative Clauses First

**(a)** Start with your strongest proposals.

**(b)** Make each clause specific and actionable.

**(c)** Add sub-clauses for implementation details.

### Step 4: Add Preambulatory Clauses

**(a)** Provide context for your operative clauses.

**(b)** Reference relevant past actions and current concerns.

**(c)** Keep this section concise.

## Presenting Your Resolution

When your resolution comes to the floor, you'll need to present and defend it.

### Introduction

**(a)** Briefly explain the problem your resolution addresses.

**(b)** Highlight the most important operative clauses.

**(c)** Explain why your approach will be effective.

### Defending Against Questions

**(a)** Know every clause in your resolution thoroughly.

**(b)** Be prepared to explain the reasoning behind each proposal.

**(c)** Have answers ready for likely criticisms.

### Handling Amendments

**(a)** Decide in advance which clauses are essential and which are negotiable.

**(b)** Accept friendly amendments that improve the resolution.

**(c)** Be prepared to argue against unfriendly amendments that undermine your goals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should a resolution be?

There's no set length, but quality matters more than quantity. Include enough clauses to address the issue comprehensively, but don't pad with unnecessary content. Most effective resolutions have 5-8 preambulatory clauses and 8-15 operative clauses.

### Can a resolution have multiple sponsors?

Yes, but there's a limit (typically 5% of the committee, rounded up). Choose sponsors strategically—they should be active participants who will help present and defend the resolution.

### What's the difference between sponsors and signatories?

Sponsors are the main authors and are responsible for the resolution's content. Signatories just want to see it debated—they can vote against it later. Being a signatory doesn't imply endorsement.

### How do I decide between similar operative phrases?

Choose based on the strength of action you want. "Demands" is stronger than "urges," which is stronger than "encourages." Match the phrase to the urgency and importance of the clause.

### What if my resolution fails?

Failure is a learning opportunity. Analyze why delegates voted against it—was it the content, the politics, or something else? Use that insight for your next resolution.
